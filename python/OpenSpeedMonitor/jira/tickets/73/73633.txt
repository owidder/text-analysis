Update sample bank data	"See the attached file for the whole set of the updated sample data. Use this set for the Coporate Edition.



The sample data for the Lite edition has to be derived from the new Corporate Edition set. As a start see the actual lite edition demo data set and delete the attributes and saved queries from the new set, so that it matches the current set.





Steps: 

# put data file from attached ZIP into a bundle

# start bundle

# start a lite edition bundle for comparison

# in the bundle, remove all attribute definitions that are _not_ in the lite edition

# in the bundle, remove all spread sheet queries and diagrams and dashboard templates and dashboards that do not longer work

# export to XMI (internal) via hidden internal export screen

# replace bank data sample XMI file with the one created above

# test db initialization with new XMI file

# done
