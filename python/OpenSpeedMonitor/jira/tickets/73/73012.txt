File Upload in Reactor doesn't work properly	"relevant for IE (9+) and Chrome (firefox works)



*How to reproduce:*

* go to IC, grafics reactor

* upload any file via ""Upload File""

* delete this file vie ""Delete File""

* try to upload *the same* file on more time.



*Expected*: file will be uploaded

*Actual*: nothing happens



possible reason: file picker dialog may keep the previous filename and do want to upload ""the same"" file two times."

"01/Mar/16 1:17 PM;fka;IE 9 not supported by New Client and Reactor



Do not take into account IE9 "	"02/Mar/16 2:01 PM;gph;+Lessons learned:+

* Firefox fires a change event, even if a file is uploaded a second time.

* Chrome/IE do not fire a change event when the same file is uploaded a second time, because the file upload INPUT-tag's value doesn't change (correct behavior according to specification).

* IE prevents resetting the value with jq/angular's ""element.val('')"", because it is readOnly=true and hence not editable programmatically.



+Solution which works in all browsers:+

* Wrap the file upload INPUT-tag with a FORM-tag

* Trigger a reset event on (=clear) the field after each upload programmatically.



This way the element keeps its properties (listeners!) and the change event will be fired again when the same file is uploaded again."	07/Mar/16 3:47 PM;pzi;tested on FF 44, IE11 and Chrome 49. Works as expected and the changes seem to make sense
