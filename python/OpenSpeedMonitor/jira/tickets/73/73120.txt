Validator warnings are actually debug messages	"See following log messages:

{noformat}

[WARN ] 11-Feb-2016 10:04:26 [elasticmi.read.InterfaceInformationFlowConsistencyValidator] Can't build instance of this validator, because not all required types are available.

[WARN ] 11-Feb-2016 10:51:26 [validate.model.DomainIdentityUniquenessConstraintValidator] Structured Type InformationSystem[@id=""94719""] of type class de.iteratec.iteraplan.elasticmi.metamodel.partial.b.BMainExportType has no defining elements. It will be skipped for Domain Identity Uniquness Validation.

[WARN ] 11-Feb-2016 10:51:26 [elasticmi.read.InterfaceInformationFlowConsistencyValidator] Can't perform model validation! The metamodel is in invalid state for this validator.

These messages should actually be DEBUG messages, as the cases in which they are logged are completely normal use cases where the things that can't be validated don't need to be validated."
