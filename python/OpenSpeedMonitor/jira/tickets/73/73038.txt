Problems while async. loading of translation map	"*How to reproduce*

* go to LSD

* change language to german

* click on content element, tool area -> new filter (to edit combined filter)

* names of relationshipends are not translated!



Problem probably occurs because translation map loading  is still not ready, when combinedFilter2 tries to translate keys. 

route change and diagram configuration creating should happen after language is actualy changed (after map is loaded)"		Bug	iteraplan PO	11/Feb/16 3:58 PM	21/Apr/17 4:58 PM					translate
