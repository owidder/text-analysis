[^iteraplan-5.1.0.log] _(11 kB)_"	16/Feb/16 2:54 PM;stefan.neubauer@hackhofer.at;same problem occurs with our installation of iteraplan 5.0.5 as well.	"18/Feb/16 9:04 AM;sfe;According to the log file this issue happens when attempting to create a Landscape Diagram, is this correct?



How does the error manifest? Is it an iteraplan error page or something different?



If it is an error page, does iteraplan offer a problem report to download?

If yes, please attach the problem report. Else please download the iteraplan system info from Administration->Configuration in iteraplan and attach it here.



The problem report and system info are only accessible to iteraplan users with the role iteraplan_Supervisor or roles that inherit their permissions from iteraplan_Supervisor."	"18/Feb/16 11:39 AM;stefan.neubauer@hackhofer.at;The error happens independent of the diagram type. Error message as in description, see also attached screenshot.
Problem report: see attachment.

According to the problem report, iteraplan can't read or write from/to this file.
Can you please check the file system permissions for the home directory of the tomcat user and see whether read/write permissions are granted?"	"23/Feb/16 2:24 PM;stefan.neubauer@hackhofer.at;Thanks, creating the appropriate directory did the trick, works fine now.

Best regards
