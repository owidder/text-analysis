Reactor can't upload empty files	"*How to reproduce*:

* creater an empty file (e.g .txt without content)

* try to upload it to the reactor sand box via reactor UI.



*Expected*: file will be uploaded properly

*Actual*: ""error while uploading file"" is logged.



By the way: if you upload any empty file by puting it in the reactor folder and try to _delete_ it via Reactor UI it will fail too.

Downloading emtpy files most likely doesn't work either.



reproduced in IE, Firefox and Chrome"		Bug	iteraplan PO	11/Feb/16 11:39 AM	06/Jun/16 2:38 PM					reactor									11/Feb/16 12:45 PM;sfe;I don't care whether empty file upload works or not, but it should be possible to delete/download empty files.	"19/May/16 11:48 AM;ach;Analysed so far:

* File deleting via Reactor UI causes no problems

* Downloading fails because server returns 204 Status (No Content) and browser can not save this response as file. (downloading is tricky implemented client side. we add html-link to the DOM and simulate a click on it). Response turns to 204 because content size of the FileRepresentation is 0.

* Uploading causes a NullPointerException in rest.representation.ReactorStatusRepresentationHandler. But after page refresh the file appears in the sandbox properly"	"25/May/16 1:26 PM;ach;solution discussed with [~sfe]

- fixed upload and delete

- server exports file sizes within getList-JSON

- client shows filesize behind filenames

- download button is disabled for empty files



NOTE: server and IC code were changed: use actual version of server code to test IC."
