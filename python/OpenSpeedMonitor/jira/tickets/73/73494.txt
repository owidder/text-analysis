I'm not sure I understand for which system you are requesting access.

You're already using the new support desk system. Just click the first or second item to raise a technical question or report a problem.

Use request access to either request access to the customer area of the iteraplan forum or request reading access to our internal development ticketing system.

Best regards
Fabian Kainzinger"
