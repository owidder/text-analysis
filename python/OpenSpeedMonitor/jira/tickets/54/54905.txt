Toolarea for Coloring	See ITERAPLAN-3858	54903	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	25/Aug/15 8:18 AM	16/Sep/15 9:46 AM					toolArea									"14/Sep/15 4:49 PM;msr;Review-Comments:



* ifdToolAreaViewModelBuilder:

getAllAttributes() is called twice during building of toolarea-items in this class. Please call it once, save it in a local variable and use this local variable twice.



* Function:

Error: It does not ""save"" the style,

i.e. if you choose a coloring, then de-select your Information Sytems (Toolarea disappears) and click again on an Information System (new Toolarea appears), the coloring-entry is no longer bold.

-> Is this part of this ticket? If yes, please fix it."	"14/Sep/15 6:23 PM;ach;fixed both things:

- invoke getAllAttributes() once - trivial

- selection dissapears after deselecting and new selecting of a node - typing mistake (using currentIndex instead of index now)"
