Localise values and attribute column header in list view	"Currently, the status values in the list views of the interactive client are not localised.

Additionally, the localisation of the header of the status column only works because there's an entry ""STATUS"" in the top level of the locale-xx.json files.



To do:

Localise all enumeration attribute columns in list views. User defined enumerations have localisation data as well (even if it is the same text in each locale), so no distinction between userdefined and predefined enums is necessary.



General idea:

* Get the persistent name of the column's feature

* Build the localisation key for the feature's name and display the localised header

* Look up whether the feature is an enumeration or not

** If it is an enumeration, build the appropriate lookup key for the metamodel localisation and use it to display localised values in the data rows."		Bug	iteraplan PO	24/Aug/15 2:56 PM	03/Sep/15 10:16 AM					list
