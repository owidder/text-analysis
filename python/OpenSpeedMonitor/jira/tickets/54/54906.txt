Logic for Coloring (ItemDecorator & Configuration)	"*Summary:*

Implement the coloring logic for the Information Flow Diagram *without* any user interaction or legend.



*Affected parts of the system:*

* ifdItemDecorator

* ifdConfiguration



*Approach:*

Save the actual coloring configuration in the ifdConfiguration. The ifdConfiguration reads and writes the coloring configuration to the url.

The ifdConfiguration is injected in the ifdItemDecorator. The ifdItemDecorator does the coloring of the Information Systems based on the ifdConfiguration."	54903	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	25/Aug/15 8:19 AM	23/Sep/15 1:02 PM					coloring									"22/Sep/15 3:03 PM;fro;checked in 2 commits accidentally in the wrong ticket.
