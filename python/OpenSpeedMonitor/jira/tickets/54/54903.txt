Colouring by enumeration attributes	"*Summary:*

Create the option for the Information Flow Diagram to colour by enumeration attributes.



*Affected parts of the system:*

* ifdConfiguration

* ifdController

* ifdContentController

* ifdContentMain

* ifdItemDecorator

* ToolArea

* ifdLegendMain

* ifdLegendBuilder



*Approach:*

* Use the Landscape Diagram as a blueprint.

* Use GoJS

* Use the ifdConfiguration as well as the url to save actual coloring

* Decide, if you want to create an extra class for ifdLegendColoring (to ensure the ifdLegendBuilder gets not too big)

* No colorpicker at the moment"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	25/Aug/15 8:13 AM	23/Sep/15 2:39 PM					coloring	ifd
