* Url: Save selected building block type and selected row to the url



*UI:*

* Legend: ""Header"" (German ""Kopfzeile"") \n localised Building Block Type

* Legend: ""Row(s)"" (German: ""Zeile(n)"") \n localised name of selected row

* Toolarea:

** Main entry on first position: ""Header"" (German ""Kopfzeile"")

** Sub-entries of header: ""Building Block Type"" (German: ""Bebauungselement"")

** Sub-entries of header: ""Attribute"" (German: ""Merkmal"")

** Sub-entries of Building Block Type: All Building Block Type names sorted alphabetically"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	25/Aug/16 4:08 PM	14/Sep/16 5:21 PM														26/Aug/16 10:29 AM;msr;Ticket already discussed on 26th August	02/Sep/16 12:07 PM;roia;Review: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-26	"13/Sep/16 3:44 PM;ants;Review comment:
