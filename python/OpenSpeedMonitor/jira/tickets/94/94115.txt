Attributes as diagram-basis (=header)	"*Summary:*

Extend the existing Cluster Diagram to be based on attributes (i.e. as header) instead of Building Block Types (at the moment).

All attributes are possible except for date interavals



*As-Is:*

* Only Building Block Types can be selected as basis for the diagram



*To-Be:*

* Attributes or Building Block Types can be selected as basis for the diagram



*Implementation Details:*

* After selecting the attribute all possible values are shown as header (values = columns)

* Default there is the alphabetically first Building Block Type row selected (Fallback: alphabetically first relation)

* Url: Save selected attribute and selected row to the url



*UI:*

* Legend: ""Header"" (German ""Kopfzeile"") \n Attribute name

* Legend: ""Row(s)"" (German: ""Zeile(n)"") \n localised name of selected row

* Toolarea:

** Main entry on first position: ""Header"" (German ""Kopfzeile"")

** Sub-entries of Header: ""Building Block Type"" (German: ""Bebauungselement"")

** Sub-entries of Header: ""Attribute"" (German: ""Merkmal"")

** Sub-entries of attributes: All attribute names sorted alphabetically"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	25/Aug/16 11:12 AM	13/Sep/16 8:38 AM														26/Aug/16 10:21 AM;msr;Ticket already discussed on 26th August	"07/Sep/16 3:08 PM;tam;As already discussed:

# Also date time should be displayed

# Empty columns are allowed. That mean if for some header values there are no data, so the empty column will be displayed"	"07/Sep/16 3:20 PM;tam;About range for numeric values.



Let look at all possible cost values from the bank data. The list is already sorted

1.00, 10.00, 15.00, 38.00, 40.00, 50.00, 80.00, 100.00, 300.00, 400.00, 500.00, 600.00, 700.00, 800.00, 900.00, 1000.00, 2000.00, 4000.00, 5000.00



In the old client we have following range: <38, 38-100, 100-600, 600-700, > 700



Here is the implementation idea to create ranges for numeric values in the new client.

# Get count of the elements in the list. If there are just 5 or less values, just display this values

# otherwise compute delta = count / 5

# For range values get element at positions delta, 2*delta, 3*delta, 4*delta



So for the costs we have delta = 19 / 5 = 3.8. We would take the element at position 3, 7, 11, 15 => these are 15, 80, 500, 900

The range is then < 15, 15-80, 80-500, 500-900, >900

We use the computed ranges as follow: the lower bound is included, the upper bound is excluded. In our case that means => v<15, 15<=v<80, 80<=v<500, 500<=v<900, v>=900



Please note, we will need this computation also in other diagrams => that's why it should be kind of common functionality."	"07/Sep/16 4:54 PM;tam;Since responsibility attributes are not contained in the metamodel, they won't be handled in this sprint.

A follow-up ticket is created IPTS-165"	08/Sep/16 4:53 PM;tam;Please add handling to filter out 'the direction' attribute	"12/Sep/16 3:17 PM;tam;For now attributes of relations and business mappings are already selectable in the toolarea. However for them no content will be displayed.



That's why there is a follow-up ticket for attributes of relations and business mappings: IPTS-167"	"12/Sep/16 6:00 PM;ants;Unit tests added according to Review comments.
