Save the zoom in the url

The diagram is initially zoomed out to the see the full diagram (like the Portfolio Diagram)



Before a zooming action of the user happens, always show the whole diagram (i.e. adjust the zoom level after each change to diagram.) After the first zooming of the user, the user ist repsonsible for adjusting the zoom, do not change the zoom level automatically any more.



Show the zoom level in the legend (in %, only integer part, no fractional part).

Zoom limits: 1% - 200%
