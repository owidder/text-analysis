MPD: Icon for infrastructure too large	"In the MPD the wrong (large) instead of the small icon is used. This disturbs the whole layout.



See screenshot.



Please exchange the icon to the proper one."		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	29/Aug/16 4:50 PM	19/Sep/16 1:22 PM														"16/Sep/16 5:46 PM;ants;Currently correct small icon is used for Infrastructure element. But it is 15 pixels wide and 28 pixels high (app/images/icons-15-white/12-Infrastructure-element.png).

Big icon is 23 pixels wide and 43 pixels high.

Currently used small icon is higher than default diagram header row height (20 pixels), so row height is adjusted by goJS to fit icon height.

To resolve issue, described in current ticket, icon for infrastructure was resized to 10x18 pixels and then its canvas size changed to 15x18.
