New layout after discussion with Fabian	"Please adapt the layout of the Portfolio Diagram:



1. Gap:

For Discrete positioning (enum - enum): Put a small gap between the bubbles in one cell (=quadrant), so they do not stick to each other

2. Border line:

Use the background color of the diagram as border line color for the bubbles

3. Font size:

Increase font size of text within bubbles

4. Wrapping of long names:

*Analyse if it is possible with GoJS:* If names are longer than the wrapping of 3 lines, let the texts overlap over the borders of the bubbles.

5. Bubble sizes:

Minimial bubble size stays unchanged. Default bubble size still equal average bubble size. But the maximum bubble size should increase PfdConfiguration.Constants.MAX_SIZE to 300."

Using two separate templates for one object is bad practice and it is hard to maintain such code.	"12/Sep/16 11:20 AM;ants;Review done https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-35
