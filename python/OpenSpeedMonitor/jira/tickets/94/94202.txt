Change order of rows	"*Summary:*

Change order of rows: 

* If easy to implement: Drag & Drop. 

* -Alternative: Move up/down/bottom/top-buttons-



*Implementation Details:*

* Analyse, if you can use native GoJS-drag & drop (would be best solution)

* -Dragging-area would be the name of the row on the left, e.g. Technical Component-

* -Alternative: Place the 4 buttons on the left of each row-

* -Alternative: Layout use grey small icons (visible, but not in focus for user). Icons to be provided by Product Owner-

* Url: Save -absolute positions- in the url

** update the order of rows in the url, don't save it separately 

** this is limited, of course, to the maximum size of the uri

** about 2000 characters in the uri for Internet Explorer

** -9 characters for each row (format: ""id=position&"")-

** -about 220 row-positions to save-

** -example: row-id=a357, position=159: ""a357=159&""-

** -in the row-id: a stand for attribute, r for relation, b for BuildingBlockType-



*UI:*

* Legend: nothing to show

* Toolarea: nothing to show



UPDATE:

* The defined space over which you can drop (single) selected row(s) is located (see attached screenshots with dropping explanations):

** between the middles of height of two neighboring rows you want to drop the selected row (that makes sense for very high rows)

** above the first row

** below the last row

* Multiple selected rows can be dragged & dropped too (ticket IPTS-178)

* The defined space over which you can drop multiple selected rows is the same as described above for single selected row, but for multiple rows only position of the highest located (and selected) row is used for defining where the ""group"" of selected rows will be located fter dropping  "		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	26/Aug/16 8:34 AM	27/Sep/16 9:44 AM														26/Aug/16 10:37 AM;msr;You can only re-order the "whole" row (e.g. all Technical Components), but you cannot re-order single lines within one row (e.g. BS200 and all other Technical Components in this line).	26/Aug/16 10:57 AM;msr;Ticket already discussed on 26th August	06/Sep/16 3:03 PM;tam;After discussion with [~fka], we need drag-and-drop.	15/Sep/16 5:35 PM;dmkh;Some changes related to this ticket were already implemented in IPTS-173.	16/Sep/16 9:08 AM;dmkh;[~fka], while experimenting I noticed that multiple selection (Hold CTRL + Left Mouse Clicks) and dragging of rows is also possible (see attachments or try it in current implementation of the diagram). Will this feature be useful in Classic Cluster diagram?	19/Sep/16 11:16 AM;tam;[~dmkh] This feature is great! And yes, it will be very usefull	"20/Sep/16 1:54 PM;dmkh;??Dragging-area would be the name of the row on the left, e.g. Technical Component??

[~fka], this requirement is hard to implement using current diagram layout. Do we really need it?

Currently user can click and drag the whole row."	21/Sep/16 3:09 PM;fka;Dragging the whole row is fine. Specific dragging area not needed.	23/Sep/16 2:23 PM;dmkh;Case with changing of rows of multiple row selection is in follow-up ticket IPTS-178	"27/Sep/16 9:44 AM;roia;Great solution!
