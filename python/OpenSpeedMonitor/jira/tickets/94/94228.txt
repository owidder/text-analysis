Filter-Extension: Select & Deselect result set (checkboxes)	"*Summary:* When filtering, the user should always be able to directly manipulate the current result set by excluding (manually) certain results.



*Implementation details:*

Extend the common combinedFilter for all diagrams and lists:

1. First you can filter with the existing filter capabilites (but you do not have to)

2. The result set is previewed as a list with checkboxes, see below for UI

3. You can select and deselect single listelements or all listelements

4. The final selected result set is taken as outcome of the filter

The list can be opened at a later point in time again to edit the selection.

As soon as the user changes the filter clauses in some way, the manual selection list is reset to default (all elements).



Store in the URL (only if the manual selection has been used in some way, i.e. not all elements are selected), default is no manual selection and the same URL as of now. Store the (positive) selection of elements in the URL. This selection incorporates the maximum number of results, even if the filter might produce more results in the future. In other terms, the filter clauses have prio number one, then the results of the filter clauses are narrowed down with the manual selection, which has prio two.



*UI:*



* Filter dialoge:

** Remove the title ""Filter"", instead use the space for two new tabs. Put them on the left hand side of the dialog.

** First tab ""Filter""/""Filter"", functionality and layout as of now: standard clause based filtering

** Second/Result tab ""Manual selection""/""Direkte Auswahl"": New!

Shows all result elements (regarding the currently set filter clauses). Sorted alphabetically, each one with a checkbox in front.

Above the list: On the left side, text ""WÃ¤hle:"" / ""Select:"" then two buttons: ""Alles""/""All"" & ""Nichts""/""None""

Above the list, on the right side: Quick search box with grey text inside ""Suche...""/""Search..."", as in the list view

  When typing, immediately quick search the list

  All & None only apply to the currently visible elements!

Result tab should have scrollbars, if necessary

The minimum height of the whole filter dialogue should be doubled. If many clauses are added, it will still grow in height like it is now.



* Legend: if manual selection is active, show below the filter criteria (might be none) -""User selection: Showing x of y"" / ""Benutzerdefiniert: Zeige x von y""-

* Toolarea: No change

""check in the filter dialog for persistent name === ""InformationFlow"" and then use the name of a related InformationSystemInterface"".

Please add a comment in the code, that this is needed for the edges of the IFD.
