Extend metamodel for Cluster Diagram	"1. Extend metamodel: getAllBuildingBlockTypesRelatedTo(attribute)

Loop through all Building Block Types and save the resulting map locally. If this map already exists (is cached), use the existing one.



2. GetListOfAllAttributes()

Use same caching mechanism as above"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	26/Aug/16 10:47 AM	02/Sep/16 1:24 PM														26/Aug/16 10:48 AM;msr;Ticket already discussed on 26th August	"02/Sep/16 11:38 AM;roia;Review: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-25

Suggestion after review: also add method {{getAllBuildingBlockTypeNamesRelatedTo()}}, which would return already cached array of building block names for an attribute.

Suggestion implemented in revision 4235"	"02/Sep/16 11:40 AM;roia;{quote}
