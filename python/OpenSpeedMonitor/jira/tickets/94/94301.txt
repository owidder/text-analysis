N3CD: Allow attributes as inner & outer elements	"*Summary:*

As inner or outer elements in the N3CD (but not both at once): Attributes should be selectable.



*Implementation Details:*

Let us call ""area"": inner or outer elements

* All attributes - except for date intervals, ""Direction"" and attributes that are only assigned to business mappings or attributable relationsships - of the other area should be available. Mechanism according to the landscape diagram.

* In case an attribute is assigned for both a building block and business mapping (or attributable relation) show only according buiding blocks and not business mapping

* Use the single values not ranges for numeric attributes.

* Additional nesting (menu ""Outer nesting""/""Inner nesting"") is disabled for the area if an attribute is selected, as there is no nesting logic for attributes.

* If an attribute selected in one area, in the other area no attribute and only building blocks which contains this attribute can be selected.

* If an attribute selected in one area, in *this area*

** if this area === outer, then show all Building Block Types

** if this area === inner, show only Building Block Types which are 2-steps away from the Building Block in the outer area (existing implementation).

* Store config in the URL.



*UI:*

* Legend: Show attribute name instead of Building block name. Don't show ""Outer nesting"" or ""Inner nesting"", if an attribute has been selected for the area.

* Toolarea: ""Cluster""/""Cluster by"" menu should have an attribute submenu (""Attribute"" / ""Merkmal""). Display it always at the bottom, leave the bulding block types on top level. Entries in this submenu like in landscape diagram.
