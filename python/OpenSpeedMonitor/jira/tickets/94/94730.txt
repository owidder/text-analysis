Fix dependencies for license generator build	"Currently, the license generator java app has a dependency to a class in the iteraplan project, and transitively to iteraplan-common-base.

This is no big issue to run the license generator from for example eclipse. You can just add the iteraplan project to the build path.

If you want to create an executable license generator jar file, however, maven can't find the necessary dependencies.

Right now, this means to build a license generator jar file, one needs to do the following steps:

* Install iteraplan-base.jar of the appropriate version in your local maven repository

* Add maven dependencies to the license generator pom file, for:

** The mentioned iteraplan-base.jar

** iteraplan-common-base



Please devise a way for the license generator to be build-able out of the box."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	31/Aug/16 1:29 PM
