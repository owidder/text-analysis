Enable sorting in visualizations	"As-is:

Sorting of elements (on the same level/within one box etc.) is done alphabetically.



Should-be:

The sorting method should be selectable by the user. Available options might include

Position in the hierarchy, value of an numerical attribute, alphabetically, size of group (e.g. ncd).... ; inverse sorting should be possible
