New History	"Reimplement the history function either using Envers in a better way than now or by facilitating our own methods and functions.



Provide history information via REST, so that the new Client or iteraplan users can retrieve it. 

Provide a possibility for a one-time migration of existing history entries.



The (new) database tables needed for the history should be present all the time. It should be possible to enable/disable the history via the admin gui."		Epic	iteraplan Thunderduck	24/Aug/16 2:02 PM
