Visible Toolarea and clickhandlers for each row	"*Summary:*

Implement an always visible Toolarea and clickhandlers for each row and the header



*Implementation Details:*

* Implement clickhandlers for the header and each row, so the Toolarea changes with each left click on an diagram element (like in the Nested Cluster Diagram)

* Reason: Each row and the header have different filters and colorings in the Toolarea (this is out of scope for this ticket). In this ticket only different toolareas are in scope indendent of their content

* There are three different types of toolareas: attribute-row-toolareas (without coloring and different filtering), BuildingBlockType+Relation-row-toolareas (with coloring and the standard combinedFilter) and the header toolarea (type of diagram changeble between BBT and attributes, adding of rows and general options like hierarchical names)

* The initial Toolarea is the header toolarea.

* At the left beginning of the Toolarea show an icon to switch to the Header Toolarea (icon to be provided by the Product Owner)

* -Right of the icon for the header display a text ""Row 1"" (German: ""Zeile 1"") for the first row and ""Row n"" for the nth row-

* Either the icon for the header or the nth row is highlighted (similiar to the Nested Cluster Diagram)

* Url: nothing to save in url



*UI:*

* Legend: nothing to do
