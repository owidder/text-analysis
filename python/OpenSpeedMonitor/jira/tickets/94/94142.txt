Filtering for Specialised and Superordinate broken	"The filtering in the new client is defunct for two special cases:

Filtering according to relations, then select Specialised or Superordinate. 



Errors are shown in the console, the filtering does not take effect. This happens independently of the chosen base type of the filter.



The bug is probably caused by the fact, that persistentName and not persistentTypeName is used."		Bug	iteraplan Quickfox	25/Aug/16 5:09 PM	02/Sep/16 2:41 PM
