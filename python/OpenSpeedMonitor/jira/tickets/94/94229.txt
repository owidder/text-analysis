Filter-Extension: Attribute-filtering with checkboxes	"*Summary:*

Create a variant of the common combinedFilter, which is able to filter attribute values and not building blocks, like the classic variant. 

Also implement the ""select and deselect""-feature of IPTS-139 for this variant.

Extend the LegendFilterBuilder to build the legend for filtering of attribute values.



All types except: date intervals, ""Direction"" and attributes which are exclusively assigned to business mappings or attributable relations



*UI*

Similar to combinedFilter.



1. Two tabs

* One tab for filtering

** Name of attribute in the title area of the filter panel

** Static text field ""Value"" / ""Wert"" (instead of selector for attribute in the classic variant) + selection box for filter operators + input field if needed depending on the attribute type (input textfield, slider, date widget; see below)

** Only ""and"" and ""or"" combinations possible, no filtering for relations or similiar

* Another tab to see the result and to be able to select or deselect entries from it (including the ""Unspecified"" entry), see IPTS-139: *only for enum* (not for text, numeric, date or description)



2. Two buttons for close and undo



*Attribute types and filter operations:* same as for Combined filter, no duration types.



*Development approach:*

1) Investigate Combined filter functionality

2) Extend datamodel/metamodel (attributes and their values for all related bb types)

3) Create new separate AttributeFilter class skeleton

4) Create new template for attribute filter

5) Implement all needed functionality for attribute filter

6) Manual selection of attribute values in attribute filter (enum values only)

7) Attribute filter panel for legend

8) Implement filter in CCD (IPTS-141)

9) Manual testing

10) Unit tests"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	26/Aug/16 1:38 PM	06/Dec/16 9:46 AM														"22/Sep/16 4:43 PM;roia;Questions for the pre-planing discussion:

1. Update task description with the clarification for the UI of the first tab for each of field types.

2. Backend for the min/max, possible values, for each of field types. E.g., numeric range for the ""Costs"" and ""Strategic Value"" fields is completely different. Probably, we need to extend the implementation of the IPTS-168 with all attributes, not just responsibility.

3. 

bq. Another tab to see the result

  what exactly should be shown here? All building block types which have the attribute? E.g., by default, there're 13 building block types which have the ""Accountability"" property. Show records from all of them? in tabs? collapsible panels (accordion)? etc?

4. Legend?"	"26/Sep/16 2:29 PM;fka;[~roia], regarding your questions:

1. done

2. Good point, didn't think about this. Maybe a quick solution would be: Calculate the numeric ranges ad hoc from the attribute values? Eould that be feasible? 

3. The second tab shows the (remaining) attribute values, after filter clauses in the first tab have been applied. E.g., for Accountability: Filter clause is: ""is not"" & ""tom"". The values ""sue"", ""bob"" and ""joe"" remain and are shown in the second tab. Then there manual deselecting can take place.

4. Like in the filter variant for building blocks: Show the applied clauses and - if applicable - ""showing x of y"".

1. Checkboxes for text, num or date?



Still under discussion"	"19/Oct/16 3:55 PM;dmkh;[~msr], please move all new specifications and requirements into the ticket description. So there will be a single and clear vision of filter implementation.



Also, specify OR/AND functionality for attribute filter"	30/Nov/16 4:27 PM;msr;Please exclude the "hardcoded" attributes which are not within the REST-API "/api/attributes" from all filters, e.g. lastModificationTime, lastModificationUser, Id, position, ...	05/Dec/16 2:52 PM;dmkh;For reviewer: also added documentation to the user guide (https://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan55/Filtering - Attribute filtering paragraph)	"06/Dec/16 9:46 AM;viol;Review is done: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-210
