Filter for Building Block Types & Relations (header + rows)	"*Summary:*

Implement the combinedFilter for all Building Block Types & Relations in the header and in the rows.

This is just the standard combinedFilter. The extension to select and deselect is in another ticket.

Attributes in header or rows are out of scope in this ticket.



*Implementation Details:*

* Check, if combinedFilter works with Relations. If not, fix it.

* Url: Save filtering in the url



*UI:*

* Legend: Use the existing LegendFilterBuilder, put the legend-filter-entry under the header or the respective  row (like in the Masterplan Diagram)

* Toolarea: *remember the header and each row have a separate toolarea*
