Counting cells from *rows* x *columns* can be confusing when we have a concrete partial limit in Cluster diagram, for example:

- partial limit is 10

- we have 3 columns with 3 rows = 9 cells



Limit is reached and next row(column) will not be built. Partial message tells us that 10 table cells are displayed but actually 9 are. Also because of tabular layout we can't distinguish cells of a ""table"" in case when some of values are unspecified and not displayed. 



So I decided to count ""actual"" cells, which represents some defined value in Cluster diagram, doing this partial message make sense and do not confuse a user."	13/Sep/16 8:55 AM;dmkh;[~viol], I have added minor fix for unit tests in revision *4323*, please check	"13/Sep/16 4:23 PM;viol;Review is done.
