Eliminate the translate service from Filterimplementation	"* Fiter-Constructors and Filter-Methods (CombinedFilter_2-...-singleXfilter) get the translate service as parameter.



* it's a bad practice! Filter should operate with translation key only. Key2Value convertion only on Presentation Layer (GoJS / Angular Templates)!



* remove unused parameter from constructors and clean up the whole code in app/js/common/filters



* Problem: using of translate in singleDateFilter with translateDate() utility method.

** this method brings the date into the local format. 

** follow the principle of point 2. call this method on presentation rendering, not within filter implementation.

* Problem: readable name of enum literal in singleEnumFilter:

** Possibly let controller do it, if no solution to do it in template can be found.



* Adjust unit Tests



Affected Filtes: andFilter.js, CombinedFilter_2.js, orFilter.js, relEndFilter.js,

2 ways to build a XSingleFilter

* (1) as a combination of the parts: type, property, operator, and value

* (2) parsing its part of the URI / location string: one argument (plus injections)



(1) is the primary way, so this is the real (and only) constructor function



(2) cannot be a constructor, because there can only be one.



(2) can be a static factory function of the class XSingleFilter



(2) should be function of XSingleFilter, so that the knowledge about the structure for serializing and deserializing is in the same class."	"29/Feb/16 10:29 AM;ach;after discussion with [~sfe]

* _singleEnumFilter_ should keep functionality for determination of literal's translation keys. 

* therefore: 

** _singlefilterHolder_ should have _initByURI()_ method like other filters. 

** use _filterDialogDataProvider_ to get translation keys for literals. "	"15/Mar/16 10:07 AM;ach;Done (commited to FilterBranch):

* removed translate service from singleDateFilter



Done (commited to trunk)

* removed translate service from singleEnumFilter

* new method init assigns operator and values to filter

* activated and fixed integration test for uri<->filter conversion.



Not in scope of this ticket:

* unit tests for uri<->filter-conversion

* proper init methods for other singleFilters.

* spike solution of saving filterinformation in url"
