Create angular directive that represents a single filter	"Goal: 

Provide an angular-directive that can be used by the filterDialog to represent a single filter.

Functionality: 

* The directive provides a set of possible attributes by which a given type can be filtered

* If an attribute has been selected the directive shows a selection of possible comparison 

  operators and if applicaple an inputField which depends on the attribute type and operator.

* The directive detects when a filter shall be applied. This depends on the filter's type.

  (e. g. Enum filter shall be applied after selection of a value (?), textFilter by pressing    

  enter.) Needs to be properly specified.

* The directive contains a delete button.



Suggestion for the control flow

[~wfr]:

-The directive's controller knows it's superior controller and notifies it if delete has been clicked or if the shall be applied"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	03/Feb/16 3:26 PM	21/Mar/16 2:50 PM														"02/Mar/16 1:09 PM;mbr;The directive contains four methods which notify the superior controller that the filter has changed. These methods are used from within the different widgets (inputfield, slider, datapicker).

Originally, it was planned to merge them into a single method, but I guess it's better this way.
