Decision: click selected GoJS vs. Windows	"Click on one selected item in a GoJS diagram with two or more selected items does not change the selection.

In Windows (Explorer) this selects the clicked item only and deselects all others.



For a single selected item, both GoJS and Windows show the same behaviour.



Questions:

- is this a problem for the user?

- can we adjust GoJS selection strategy easily?
