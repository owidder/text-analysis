Hibernate 5	see Summary	63118	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	28/Jan/16 9:31 AM	09/Mar/16 10:44 AM														"08/Feb/16 4:08 PM;gph;In Task ""db.generateDDLScript"" there are warning messanges:

{code}

[java] [WARN ] [2016-02-08 15:51:48] (hibernate.orm.deprecation) HHH90000003: Use of DOM4J entity-mode is considered deprecated

{code}



Some Hibernate tickets claim that this issue should be already fixed in 5.0.1 and higher:

https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-10103

https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-10115



But the warning still appears in 5.0.5:

https://hibernate.atlassian.net/browse/HHH-10299



Seems to be a problem with Envers @Audited annotation. Maybe not a real problem. Waiting for a solution from Hibernate...

"	"09/Feb/16 1:28 PM;gph;Could not get rid of the following deprecation warning(s) when running ""db.reset"":

{code}

[java] [WARN ]  (hibernate.orm.deprecation) HHH90000016: Found use of deprecated 'collection property' syntax in HQL/JPQL query [null.elements]; use collection function syntax instead [elements(null)].

{code}

We don't use ""property"" syntax for ""elements"" like ""something.elements"". We only use the required ""function"" syntax ""elements(something)"". The warning is misleading, isn't it?
