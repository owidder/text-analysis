RELEASE: Extend Homescreen with Admin-Tab	"Assume REST-API on server works as designed. If it is does not exist yet, use a mockup.



*Summary:*

Extend the existing Homescreen with a new tab ""Administration"" with the tiles:

* ""System"" (German: ""System"")

* ""Attributes"" (German: ""Merkmale"")

* ""Attribute Groups"" (German: Merkmalsgruppen"")

* ""Users and Groups"" (German: Anwender und Gruppen"")

* ""Roles and Permissions"" (""Rollen und Rechte"")



*Implementation Details:*

* Permission handling (IPTS-233):

** If the information does not exist in the JSON, it means that the user has not the permission to it.

** In this case, please hide this tile and re-direct the uri to the home-screen

* ""Reload Plug-in Scripts"" should be moved within the ""System""-Tile

* As long as the functions in the tiles are not fully implemented, please redirect to the classic pages."
