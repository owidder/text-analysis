LATER: Undeploy demo instance with handle errors	"Implement a two-phase undeployment/cleanup for a demo instance:

* Stop and undeploy the demo instance application as in IPTS-113

* If demo instance application is successfully undeployed, drop demo instance database and delete logfiles and index files

* Record current status of this process in the demo registration database

* Only after cleanup step succeeded, remove the demo user from the demo registration database"	93358	Sub-task	iteraplan Speedbird	27/Sep/16 9:58 AM	27/Oct/16 8:41 AM														12/Oct/16 11:06 AM;sfe;The file {{deleteDemoInstanceDB.sql.template}} seems to be missing in the SVN repository	13/Oct/16 2:49 PM;mada;Add missed file
