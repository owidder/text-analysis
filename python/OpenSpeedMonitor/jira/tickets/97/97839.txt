Create Attribute list (read-only)	"Assume REST-API on server works as designed. If it is does not exist yet, use a mockup.



*Summary:*

Create a list of all attributes similar to the Building Block Lists.



*Implementation details:*

* Scope of this ticket is view-only - edit is in another ticket

* Use AG-Grid

* Use the same Look & Feel like the Building Block lists

* Date Intervals are part of this list and not in a separate list



*Features:*

* Quicksearch + Show number of attributes (""Showing x of y attributes"")

* Add column (incl. search for column names)

* Sort columns

* Delete columns

* Re-order columns by Drag & Drop

* Default columns: ""Name"", ""Description"", ""Attribute Group"""		New Feature	iteraplan Thunderduck	30/Sep/16 4:18 PM	24/Nov/16 9:36 AM														"13/Oct/16 5:41 PM;mwe;DONE:

* I generalized the list, so the following features are included automatically:

** Quicksearch + Show number of attributes (""Showing x of y attributes"")

** Add column (incl. search for column names)

** Sort columns

** Delete columns

** Re-order columns by Drag & Drop 

* Default columns: ""Name"", ""Description"", ""Attribute Group"" (Attribute Group is shown as ""Group"", because we are already on the attributes page and ""Attribute"" would be redundant. Agreed with [~msr]

* Added link to attribute detail view



TODO:

* Add date intervals (after the REST API is clear)

* Implement Resource to get the real attributes from the backend (after the REST API is clear) -> See saved queries list for an example of the usage of a resource with the list component"	14/Nov/16 1:50 PM;mwe;Also review [revision 5110|https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/changelog/iteraplan-9?cs=5110]	15/Nov/16 5:59 PM;mwe;The date intervals are missing currently.	"18/Nov/16 4:34 PM;mwe;Date intervals added.

Discussed with [~fka]: Removed possibility to remove column because all columns should be shown all the time. So the type column is shown, too."
