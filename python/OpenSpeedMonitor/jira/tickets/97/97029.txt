Change order of multiple selected rows	"This ticket is related to IPTS-125.



*Summary:*

Currently single row reordering is supported. But there is a possibility to select, drag & drop multiple rows. It is already implemented (IPTS-125) but an overridden {{layout.comparer}} function orders them using actual vertical position of each selected row. 



It is needed to drop them (selected rows) as a group to the new location, one by one, in the order they were located before reordering.



Also: update order of rows in the URL.
