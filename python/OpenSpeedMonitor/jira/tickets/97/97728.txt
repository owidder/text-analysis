Analyse PFD problems with attributes of responsibility type (multivalue attributes) (i.e. Accountability)	"This is follow up ticket for IPTS-179 (in which translation issues of responsibility attributes where fixed).

I will extend item builder, so there will be same multiple bubbles for different attribute values on axis. It will take *less then 1 PD*. 	10/Oct/16 12:13 PM;ants;Review done: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-56
