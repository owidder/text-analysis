Ensure that legend is drawn after the diagram	"In the filter section of a legend we have to display the number of filtered and manually selected items:  ""User selection: Showing x of y""

To display this information, data has to be processed before the legend if drawn.



In the scope of this task this has to be implemented for all diagrams except Portfolio.

Also should be done for the lists.



*How to test:*

1. Open diagram, activate filter and make manual selection

2. Check that the legend shows correct numbers in the filter panel: ""User selection: Showing x of y""

3. Reload the page

4. Make sure the manual-selection info in the legend is still correct
