Use DecoratorFactory in the LSD	like already done in the MPD or PFD	96139	Sub-task	iteraplan Speedbird	28/Sep/16 2:35 PM	06/Oct/16 11:27 AM														03/Oct/16 10:43 AM;dmkh;[~msr], what shall we do with multiple value coloring for enum in LSD (see attached screenshots)? Currently decoratorFactory does not support this. So, if we need this feature - we must extend decoratorFactory.	"04/Oct/16 8:48 AM;msr;Please extend the decoratorFactory for multi-value-coloring.

Thanks for bringing this up."	04/Oct/16 10:06 AM;dmkh;After deeper investigation I left this functionality in Color Utils. It is independent of decoratorFactory objects and methods.	06/Oct/16 11:27 AM;ants;Review done: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-54
