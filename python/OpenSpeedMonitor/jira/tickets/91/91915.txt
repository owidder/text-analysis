Information Flow diagram shows no interfaces	"Information flow diagram should show information systems and the interfaces between them in Visio.

Generated diagrams (also those which worked well before) do not show the arrows which represent the interfaces.



See attachment for examples.

[^error infor flow diagram.docx] _(179 kB)_"	"01/Aug/16 9:32 AM;cst;Dear Mr. Marsiske, 

thank you for your enquiry.

Would you please check the ""Configuration"" of your ""Information Flow Diagram"",
because single settings can be changed with version 5.2.

When you generate the ""Information Flow Diagram"" in the ""interactiv client"",
is the diagram shown complete? 

You can open the diagram, with the button ""Visualize in interactiv client "".

Greetings,

- interactive client diagram shows interfaces (but without name)
- Visio diagram does not show any interface

see also attachment for further explanation.

kind regards

[^error infor flow diagram 2.docx] _(200 kB)_"	"01/Aug/16 11:53 AM;ansgar.marsiske@coface.com;Dear Mr. Stangl,

correction to my request:
Visio diagram shows the interfaces if I choose ""Extras / Layout neu anordnen"".
Obviously it's a problem of Visio 2007 and not of iteraplan.

For that point we can close the request.

The other issue about interactive client is more general problem:
configuration settings are not taken from classic view, it has to be set additionally in interactive client, there is no way to save and reopen a saved diagram ...

Kind regards
Ansgar Marsiske"	"01/Aug/16 1:37 PM;cst;Dear Mr. Marsiske,

that is right, settings cannot be taken over from the classic view. 
In the future it is possible to save the diagrams, but at the moment this feature is not implemented.

There is currently no definite date for this feature.
