Excel Import vs concurrency	"""Concurrent changes

Changes done to the iteraplan database after the import wizard has been started and before the import has finished completely can

lead to unexpected results or errors during execution of the actual data write.""



With this limitation if concurrency happens with import does it corrupt the database? We will make importation limited once at a time and only during the night with a command scheduled.



With this limitation that was the reason I wanted to import information system with a limited number to reduce concurrency. But it's impossible to load a subset, because we have many parent-child relations that could be deleted without asking."

thank you for your enquiry.

The database can not corrupted by a error on the import.
When the import creates an error, it stops the process and no dates are imported in your database. 

Its a good idea to do the import job at night , in order to avoid changes done to the iteraplan database.
