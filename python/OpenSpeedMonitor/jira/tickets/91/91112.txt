thank you for your enquiry. 

We have analyzed the LOG-Files and these are ok. 
To check the problem, would you please answer following questions.

Occurs the error only with the information flow diagram,  or are you able to save other types of diagrams?
Which properties are you using, to create the information flow diagram?
Can you save a information flow diagram with other properties? 

Greetings,

Christoph Stangl - iteraplan Support 

"	"22/Jul/16 9:26 AM;ansgar.marsiske@coface.com;Hello Mr. Stangl,

thank you for your reply.
it also happens with Landscape diagram.
and it also happens if I open an existing diagram and try to save it (without any changes)!
What do you mean with properties? the parameters I choose to configure the diagram? I use a selection of IS, the rework option (include all IS which are connected to the result set of the selection), some color settings and visio as output.

kind regards

thank you for your reply.

Would you please check, in the path ""<TOMCAT>\lib"", if the data ""ojdbc6.jar"" exists.
When  a older version of the database driver is used, the save function cannot be called. 

On the following page, you can find the current drivers:

we changed JDBC driver and now it works. Thank you.
