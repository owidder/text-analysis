Undo-Button in Filter does not work	"*Summary:*

The undo-button just closes the filter-dialog but does not ""undo"" anything in the Masterplan Diagram.



*Reproduce:*

* Set the filter ""name contains SAP""

* Close the filter

* Click on Filter\Level 1 in the Toolare

* Click on ""OR""

* Set additionally ""Complexity is high""

* Click on ""Undo""



*Actual:*

The filter is ""complexity is high"" is also applied



*Expected:*

The filter is ""complexity is high"" should not be applied because the diagram should be rolled-back to the state before the user has set this second filter."
