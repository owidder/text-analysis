When the Tomcat starts, many warnings are displayed and sometimes after the server startup iteraplan can not be loaded. 



Error: ""to the cache because there was insufficient free space available after evicting expired cache entries - consider increasing the maximum size of the cache"". Full error log is uploaded in the ticket.

*<Resources

        cachingAllowed=""true""

		cacheMaxSize=""30000"" (This is smallest setting iteraplan starts on my PC)
