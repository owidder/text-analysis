Create a architecture documentation for diagrams (in this case for portfolio)	"Create a generic architecture documentation for diagrams based on the Portfolio Diagram. Use the existing architecture documentation as blueprint.

* Either the documentation is so generic so it can be used for any diagram in the future

* or at least it can be reused with very small adapations for future diagrams"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	22/Jul/16 8:28 AM	31/Aug/16 10:45 AM
