thank you for your enquiry.

You can not configure the columns, as you describe it above. 
In the current version you can not shown the status of the children Information System as a column.

As work a round, you can use the Query Console of iteraplan. 

The Query Console can be found under the tab ""Reports"" and ""Query Console"". 
More information for the use of the Console, are described with following link:
