AXIS/Content Filter displays one option more when changing	"Summary:

AXIS Filter automatic displayed two options, when changing.

Content Filter automatic displayed two options, when changing.



Reproduce:

◾Click on e.g. ""only level 1""

◾Close the menu 

◾Click again on ""Axis Filter"" and  now ""Flat"" plus ""only level 1"" is active. 



The same effect can I reproduce by the ""Content Filter"".

Actual:

Expected:
