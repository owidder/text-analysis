* Sends with every REST-request to the client in the header the ETag-field with the actual lastModificationTime (/)

* The lastModificationTime is saved as global static variable on the server (/)

* The servers sets the initial lastModificationTime as startup-time of the server (/)

* The server changes the lastModificatonTime on every datamodel or metamodel-change (/)

* On Request to /api/hasChanges the server compares the timestamps and replies either 304 - not modified (no changes) or 204 - ok (has changes) without any content (/)



* Which lastModificatonTime is answered by the server?

** If the client wants to GET /api/icd, the server always returns the latest lastModificationTime

** If the client wants to PUT or POST to /api/element:

*** the server sends a new/updated lastModificationTime if the client has sent the lastModificationTime

*** the server sends the old lastModificationTime of the client to the client if the lastModificationTime is older than the latest on server (client gets only partly updated)"	91838	Sub-task	iteraplan Thunderduck	28/Jul/16 4:27 PM	10/Feb/17 9:47 AM														06/Feb/17 9:16 AM;mse;The ETag (= lastModificationTime) is saved in a singleton Spring bean instead of a static variable after discussion with [~sfe].
