All Building Block Types as Content Type	"*Summary:*

Enable all Building Block Types as Content Type even if they do not have any date interval.



*As-Is:*

* Only Building Block Types with a date interval can be selected.



*To-Be:*

* All Building Block Types and all related Building Block Types can be selected.

* If a Building Block Type without a date interval is selected, show the normal mpdDataDiagram and just do not display any timebar for this type.



*Implementation Details:*

* Url: Nothing to do in the url

* Additionally: Adapt the selection of date intervals: It is now possible to remove the last date interval.

* Additionally: Delete the logic to find an initial Building Block Type with a date interval. Information System is the initial Building Block Type if the user has the permission independently of the date intervals.



*UI:*

* Legend: Ensure that the legend works without any date interval

* Toolarea: Remove the different grey tones and the different mouse icons -> everything is selectable.

* Toolarea: Date Intervals: If there are no date intervals, remove the arrow to the right.

"11/Jul/16 4:56 PM;dmkh;The major part of requirements are implemented, but still it is impossible to remove the last date interval. Also maybe some additional unit tests are needed.
