Cleanup magic-bootstrap remnants (if possible)	"Timebox: 1 (if it takes longer -> contact [~wfr] or [~ach])

(Information from [~wfr])

At the beginning, magic-bootstrap was used to generate style files for the iteraplan new client.



It should be checked, if the files ""magic-bootstrap.css"", ""magic-bootstrap.less"" and ""magic-bootstrap-min.css"" in app/css can be removed if they are not used anyhow.



For this, check:

* Which css files are really included in index.html

* Which css classes override/modify each other



For easier analysis, it can be checked which attributes can be altered by magic-bootstrap at all.



If only very few definitions from the magic-bootstrap files are still used, these should be moved to another css file and the magic-bootstrap files should still be removed."

-> Also after talking to [~mwe] I would suggest to keep it for the time being and clean up in a larger context (e.g. when bootstrap is completely replaced by angular material or maybe within IPTQ-36)



The other two files (magic-bootstrap.less and magic-bootstrap-min.css) could be removed but should also be kept as reference for the time being."	"18/Aug/16 1:55 PM;mse;I looked at magic-bootstrap.css in a bit more detail:



* Almost all definitions up to line 262 are identical to the standard un-customized bootstrap.css from the bootstrap bower-component directory (which is *not* used by iteraplan at the moment.

* But a lot of the definitions after line 263 concern coloring or font-size/font-family. These are different in many cases from the standard bootstrap settings and must either be moved to another css file (a clean-up would be nice, of course!) or re-stored in angular material (or any other framework)."	18/Aug/16 1:56 PM;mse;Decided to fix this ticket in a larger context.
