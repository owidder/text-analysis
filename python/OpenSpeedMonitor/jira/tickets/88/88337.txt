Legend slides in and out	"*Summary:*

* Let the legend slide in and out triggered by user clicks

* Initially collapsed

* Do *not* save state of legend in the url, but save in the configuration, i.e. if the diagram is redrawn, the legend is still shown (if it was open before)

* The legend is still scrollable if it is higher than the window height

* It should not change the width of the diagram - the legend will be above the diagram

* Limit the width of the whole diagram to the window width to prevent double scrollbars.



Open questions:

* Do it just with css? (*preferred*)

* Maybe there some components in combination with angular?"
