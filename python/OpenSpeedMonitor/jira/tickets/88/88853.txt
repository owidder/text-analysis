Design of table	"The table should look like:

* Table header
** Background dark-grey
** Remove drag'n'drop icon
** Column name aligned left (with sorting icon on the very left if sorting is active for this column)
** Delete button (""X"") aligned right and always above text
** Column separator between header cells
** Column groups:
*** When there are grouped columns and non-grouped columns at the same time, the top half of the header of non-grouped columns is inactive and doesn't react to clicking and dragging
*** Possible fix: Change the look of the top half of the header (which is a separate div from the bottom half) to blend with the background, so no attempts to click it are made. Do we really need this?
*** Mouse pointer changes to drag icon when hovered?
* Rows
** No column separators
** Zebra look (alternating white and light-grey background)

The style of the table can be modified in css/ag-grid-iteraplan.css. This file was copied from here as a starting point:
