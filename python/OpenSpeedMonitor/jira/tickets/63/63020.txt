Datamodel cleanup	"[~fka] : *Document the new structure either in a new readme or a wiki-page.* -> New Subtask?



Simplify and restructure the existing Datamodel:



* separate data from metadata functionalty

* use persistent name as key for all accesses to metadata elements (type, enums, properties, connections)

* build an object structure from the metamodel JSON, initially and once.

* structure and access paths as follows: 

* datamodel -> metamodel -> types/type by name 

* type - > properties / by name

* type -> relationship end / by name

* property -> value type, maybe enum, 

* enum -> literals (vulgo: values)

* relationship end -> type

* the key for a relationship end can be simple or composite (a/b) 

* property and relationship end have multiplicity markers (optional/required, single/multiple)

* note: no direct access from metamodel to enums

* note: still no attribute groups

* note: access to the metamodel returns an object, eg. a property (type) object, not a name.o 

* note: no localized names here, but only via translation

* note: no access to feature (either property or relationship end)



make minor adjustments to datamodel, matching structure of metamodel

* separate access to property and relationship end, remove access to feature

* keep: access via composite relationship end name (a/b): resolvePath

* keep: lazy loading and cache



NOTE: JSDoc and test for everything
