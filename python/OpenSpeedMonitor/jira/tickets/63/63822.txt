LSD Hierarchy All Levels is not in url	"Change column association to ""Connected Business Process""

Show with hierarchy level -> ""All levels""

Refresh



Actual:

Show with hierarchy level is set to ""flat""



Expected

Show with hierarchy level is still ""All levels""





I think the problem is, that ""All levels"" are treated as ""null"" in the configuration"		Bug	iteraplan PO	17/Nov/15 4:22 PM	02/Dec/15 11:22 AM					hierarchy	lsd
