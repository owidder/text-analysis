Assignment-changes of IS in Interfaces not updated in Elastic	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_

# Open an Interface and edit it in iteraplan classic GUI to remove all transported Business Objects, and save.

# Request {{.../iteraplan/api/data/informationflow}} and look for the Information Flow with negative ID, connected to the edited Interface.

# Edit the Interface again and change one of the Information System assignments.

# Open the previous Information Flow again via REST API



_Expected:_ REST API returns the Information Flow data updated according to the changes in the GUI, thus showing the new IS assignment.

_Actual:_ The old assignment is still shown in REST API"		Bug	iteraplan PO	10/Nov/15 11:02 AM	13/Nov/15 10:10 AM					elastic	update
