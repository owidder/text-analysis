Permission handling in LSD '2	"Most simple solution:

* detect that this is a configuration from the URI

* detect that it is not permitted

* show a view with a message

* user can go to home screen 



Important: Check, if the loading from the URI with missing permission leads to exceptions in other diagrams, too

----

Actually you get the following exception:



{code:java}

TypeError: An exception occurred: Cannot read property 'properties' of undefined (caused by ""<div class=""main-container content-container ng-scope"" ng-view="""" data-ng-animate=""1"">"")
