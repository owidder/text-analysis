Some refactoring was done for this.

Also two unit test were adjusted"	"13/May/16 2:52 PM;abo;Review-Comments concerning _lsdToolAreaViewModelBuilder.js_, method _getPartiallyConnectedItemForToolArea()_:

* the implementation of _statusOfPartiallyConnected_ seems wrong or at least confusing - it is loaded from config, then, if set, set to a default value, and then toggled.

* the function's name _togglePartiallyConnectedStatus()_ is irritating, as it does not change any state but does an evaluation and returns a boolean value. Would be nicer if it really contains the toggle-logic and a caller does not have to know the details."	13/May/16 2:55 PM;abo;Unassigned the issue, because [~tam] currently is on vacation.	13/May/16 4:20 PM;abo;Refactored according to my previous review-comments.	"23/May/16 12:14 PM;mse;Review ok, only some small changes:



* Added ticket number to TODO comment

* Updated JSdoc

* Fixed ESlint warnings"
