Create and use filter service	"Current status, example LSD

In lsdDataService, there is a method ""setFilterFunction"" which is called from the ""configure"" method and creates all the filter predicates (except the level filter).



This code can be moved to a freshly created ""filter service"". This service is to be wired into the diagram main classes. From there it can be called with the filter configuration of a diagram area (as for example ""content"" in LSD). The filter service returns a predicate object which in turn can provide three ways to execute the filters:

* A function which takes a business object and applies all configured filters on it

* A function which takes a business object and applies all configured filters except a hierarchy filter on it

* A function which takes a business object and applies only a hierarchy filter on it.



The latter two are necessary for hierarchic filtering and aggregation.



These predicate objects can be given to the diagram's data service as parameters to return the filtered business objects.



Adjustments in data services are also part of this issue."	63109	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	11/Nov/15 9:55 AM	09/Dec/15 3:22 PM					filtering
