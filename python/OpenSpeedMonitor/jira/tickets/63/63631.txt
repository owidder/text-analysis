If you delete the property ""colorpicker-is-open=""colorPicker"""", then the colorpicker is opened by any click on this div (=legend). That's not what we want.

If you leave the property ""colorpicker-is-open=""colorPicker"""" in, then the colorpicker is only opened by the first click. Afterwards never. The reason could be (I'm not 100% sure), that the ng-click-event changes the state of colorpicker to late (i.e. after the watch on $scope.colorPicker watched on it). But I'm not sure."	18/Feb/16 1:52 PM;sfe;use estimation as time box.
