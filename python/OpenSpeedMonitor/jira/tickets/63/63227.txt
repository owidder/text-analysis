This happen also in normal ifd use . But there it is difficult to reproduce

  "		Bug	iteraplan PO	12/Nov/15 2:01 PM	17/May/16 11:15 AM														29/Mar/16 8:42 AM;sfe;Check whether this issue still happens in the given scenario. A similar problem with identical error message was recently fixed by moving the {{setToolAreaViewModelBuilder}} call in ifdController into the {{updateToolArea}} methode.	26/Apr/16 4:59 PM;pzi;bug is still present and has not been fixed	27/Apr/16 10:12 AM;pzi;I do not need to refresh for this bug - it happens even when I go to the page for the first time. Furthermore, the LSD and N3CD are affected too	12/May/16 12:03 PM;pzi;due to the different structure of IFD and LSD the bugfix cannot be transferred unchanged. Additionally a problem avoiding this is, that the LSD could have error correction (using another type if access is not possible) while this is not possible for the IFD	13/May/16 3:01 PM;pzi;bug fixed for IFD. For LSD it is not fixed because the impact for improving this properly would be significant. For this reason this has been moved to a separate ticket (ITERAPLAN-4629)
