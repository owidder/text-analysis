"	"14/Dec/15 10:15 AM;gph;Feature branch for Hibernate 4 migration is here:

https://iteraplan.iteratec.de/svn/iteraplan/branches/RB_5_1_0-FeatureBranch_Hibernate4



Working code state with Hibernate 4.3.11 is here:

https://iteraplan.iteratec.de/svn/iteraplan/tags/Release_5_1_0-working_Hibernate4_3_11_withReducedPatch"	"04/Feb/16 1:26 PM;gph;Suggestions for review/testing. These parts were affected by Hibernate migration:



* Transactions and transaction handling in general

* Behavior of: Hibernate Search Index / Fulltext Search

* Behavior of History

* Reduced Hibernate Patch and patched classes

* Neighborhood Diagram (because Point2D has changed from deprecated API to own implementation)

* Elastic loading (especially after Hibernate 5 migration)

* BBCreateDeleteLogger"	"04/Feb/16 2:52 PM;gph;Two nitpicks left over from Hibernate 4 migration:



* Hibernate Search cannot be disabled in LocalApplicationContextUtil.getApplicationContext(), because it cannot be accessed as Spring Bean anymore.

* HSQL 2.x driver writes too many warnings (in Hibernate SqlExceptionHelper) when integration tests are executed:

{code}

     [WARN ] (jdbc.spi.SqlExceptionHelper) SQL Warning Code: -1100, SQLState: 02000

     [WARN ] (jdbc.spi.SqlExceptionHelper) no data

{code}"
