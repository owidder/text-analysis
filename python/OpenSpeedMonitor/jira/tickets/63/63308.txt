Excel-Import: Improve error message when there are numbers in "parent" columns	"_Example (with sample data):_

# Export Excel Data

# In the Excel file, go to, for example, Business Process sheet and enter in at least one cell in the ""superordinate Business Process"" column a number.

# Import the Excel file



=> A unspecific error is shown, with a stack trace in the log file containing the following relevant part:

{noformat}

Caused by: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot get a text value from a numeric cell

       at org.apache.poi.xssf.usermodel.XSSFCell.typeMismatch(XSSFCell.java:845)

{noformat}



Instead of that unspecific error, make the reading of relationship end cells more robust, so it can read numbers as strings.

From there, the existing consistency checks of the Import should do the rest and provide informative error messages if necessary."
