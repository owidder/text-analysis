LSD: Remove non-visible boxes	"Actual situation:

In the LSD, in the content area there are invisible boxes for each cell that does not have an element to display.



This does not only consume rendering time, but does also increase the SVG file size.



Expected:

There are no more invisible boxes in the LSD.

To bring up the tool area when clicking anywhere on the content maybe add one large invisible box in the background which covers all of the content area. But only one box!"
