ONLY CHECK: make sure the designed architecture for LSD is complied	"Timebox: 1 hour. Please check, if there is still something to do in this ticket.



in LSDConfiguration there are three methods which do something that the lsdToolAreaViewModelBuilder.js should do. This is not conform to our LSD architecture which can be seen in app/js/lsd/_lsdArchitectureDiagram.svg .



the three methods fill the toolarea entries and are called as follows:

- getContentAxisPropertyOptions

- getColoringOptions 

- getEnumAndDateAxisPropertyOptions
