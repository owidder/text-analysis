make new jenkins jobs / edit existing ones to include integration tests 	make sure that jenkins executes the new integration tests like he does with the unit tests (check after every commit)		Improvement	iteraplan PO	27/Jan/16 2:30 PM	04/Feb/16 4:19 PM					Test									29/Jan/16 9:29 AM;lwi;didn't create a new jenkins job. Instead, just added the integration_test task to the build task in the gruntfile. This way, when jenkins executes the deploy_snapshot job, he will automatically execute the integration tests, too.
