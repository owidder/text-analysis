New combined filters ("combinedFilter_2") in IFD	"*Summary:*

Integrate new combined filter and filterDialog in the Information Flow Diagram.

This includes:

* Initialization of combinedFilter object (when opening IFD by pasting URI, when opening IFD by UI, when changing nodetype (?))

* Including the new filterDialog in IFD's toolArea.

* Adaptation of the transferAction methods. 

* Writing the combinedFilter in the URI

* Application of the combinedFilter





*Affected js-files:*

* ifdConfiguration (mainly)

* ifdToolAreaViewModelBuilder

* ifdController (maybe ""transferAction""?)

* ifdLegendBuilder (include new LegendFilterBuilder)



* Some file(s) in the folder ifdContent. Most likely: ifdDataService.js
