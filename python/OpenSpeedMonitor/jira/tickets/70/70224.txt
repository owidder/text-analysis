List with sort, filter, select	"List with sorting, filtering for all types of attributes



Selection on rows, multiple.



No edit here.

* by each row

* also by connected elements (lexicographical over names)

* also by multiple-value columns (lexicographical over words of values)



filter

* use model of filter dialog



select

UI: 

* checkbox to select/unselect

* maybe more visual feedback on selected row

* simple mode-less solution: checkbox always visible

* or: as in Google material: normal list -> selection list -- modes, really?



Use in diagram

* selection is extra elementary filter component in a composite filter

* legend: ""20 of 25 selected"" or ""5 omitted"" or so.  IN SCOPE"	"09/May/16 3:15 PM;wfr;Scope and priorities clarified with [~fka] [~sfe] [~wfr] today



* all types of building block, but not associative types as for example Isr2Bo

* OPEN: include or exclude Business Mapping?

* sort

* filter

* long lists (fast, needs virtual repeat, bottomless scrolling)

* ID is available column, not in default/initial columns, always present for UI tests 

* Select one or more rows (elements): very low priority, because needed later when integrated with diagrams

* Filter for attributes of relationships (edge attributes): low prio

* slide in legend from the right with filter settings: low prio

* NO fixed columns (name or similar)

* wide table possible, horizontal scrolling acceptable

* clean start with new code: confirmed, as discussed during ATAT planning

* text filter works in addition (technically after) the logic filter, looks in all cells of currently displayed columns in the text form.

* multiple values are comma-seperated lists, combined into one single text value. For example ""A, B, C""

* multiple connected elements are in blocks of cells with blank padding cells left and right of the column

* no filtering interaction directly in the column headers

* interaction points (up/down arrows) for sorting in the column header

* delete column by delete (cross) icon in the column header

* reorder columns with drag and drop

* business mapping: name of connected elements in three extra columns

* attribute for association in extra columns

* columns of business mapping endpoints form a contiguous group

* columns of a name of a connected element and the attributes form a contiguous group

* reordering of columns only within contiguous group, no interleaving"	"09/May/16 4:05 PM;wfr;Ticket decomposition



initially: architecture and skeleton



main axis of attack: slices by feature



parallel, but not deferred: UI tests, performance tests, tests on all browsers



finally: design cleanup, transition/integration, docs
