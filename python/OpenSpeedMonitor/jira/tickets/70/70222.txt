Links to embed diagrams and reports 	"Saved reports and diagrams can be embedded resp.  downloaded with a link to the server.



The diagram or the report must be computed and served by the server, without a running client. "		Epic	iteraplan PO	21/Jan/16 1:35 PM	12/Apr/17 1:41 PM														"25/Jan/16 4:10 PM;wfr;Basic idea:

* user has configured a diagram (or a list) and saved it under a name

* there is a resource with the given name (and some prefix) for that diagram

* a user may embed an image link to that resource name in an HTML page, or a Wiki page, or somewhere lese

* a browser (or any other HTTP client) GETs this diagram

* the RESTlet/Service gets the configuration and renders the diagram

* the rendering engine uses GoJS and our main-class/pipeline structure and the metamodel/model/translation services

* the rendering engine does not need all interaction parts of the client, or the navigation/routing



OK: GoJS runs without a browser DOM and can create an SVG

OPEN: how to render SVG to PNG without a DOM?

Idea: for PDF, call the Batik-based rendering service directly, without using HTTP operations



OPEN: 

* does GoJS run in Nashorn, or only in Node.js?

* do we need a simulated DOM, as phantom?

* can we separate our client code cleanly into ""runs also on server / runs only in the browser""



POC needed before announcing this feature

* needs basic mechanism for saved diagrams and reports on client

* can be done step by step with each feature

Problem: When generating PNG from SVG on the server via Batic the result may have slight differences compared to generating the PNG from SVG in the browser. So we should consider using the same PNG generating method everywhere, i.e. online via browser or remote via link.



Simulated DOM on the server maybe one solution. Currently we don't exactly know how GoJS does it on the browser side, probably via browser methods and therefore using a DOM."
