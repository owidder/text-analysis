types to edit: enum, date, int/num, String, bool (one special attribute)

multiple values!

connections (combobox)



basiic list edit just as in single element edit 



out of scope: geo location



Gestures: to be discussed. There should be a simple gesture 

* to navigate from row to a single element view

* to select the row

* to start editing the cell's value



Idea for bulk edit: secondary mouse click



existing: Changes client <-> server



UI only, no connection, no server
