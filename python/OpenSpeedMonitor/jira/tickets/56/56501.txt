Import/REST: Wrong amount of "changed" elements displayed	"Timebox 1
New:
Only documentation: https://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan53

###

_Reproduce (with sample data):_
Delete Business Process ""Customer Mgmt"" using the REST API

_Expected:_
* 1 Business Process changed
* 1 Business Process deleted
* a bunch of other related elements changed

_Actual:_ 4 Business Processes are listed as changed.

_Reason:_ The three sibling processes of the deleted Customer Mgmt change their position to fill the ""empty space"" left behind after the deletion. This is recognized as change.

_Possible solution:_
Since currently there is no possibility for deliberate position changes using the import, just ignore all position changes when calculating the result of the import.
See {{MiImportProcess#addImportResult}} - ignore all update diff elements which only contain position changes.

If ITERAPLAN-2102 is implemented and thus deliberate position changes are possible, we need to find another way."
