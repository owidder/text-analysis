LSD: solve the diagram > maximum canvas size	"please have a look at the following ticket 

 https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/jira/browse/ITERAPLAN-4056



find a clean way to solve this problem and replace the current quick and dirty solution.



all browsers behave different.



Ideas:

 1) Ask GoJS-Team for an idea (""virtual canvas"")

 OR

 2) Do it on the server with PhantomJS (too much effort)



Important: Full diagram download has to work



3) Live with that. When diagram size exceeds the maximal size, just show warning to user that it cannot be fully displayed and display part of it.
