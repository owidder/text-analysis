Content highlighting in LSD	"What I want to do:

# Left click a content item in LSD

# Choose ""highlight"" in tool area



=> All content items representing the same building block as the one I have selected are highlighted



Notes:

* If you click on an element, the element is selected via GoJS.

* Highlight all occurences

* Implement possiblity to clear highlights

* Include in Download

* Legend does not show this highlighting

* No mutiple highlighting. That is only one kind of building block is highlighted at a time
