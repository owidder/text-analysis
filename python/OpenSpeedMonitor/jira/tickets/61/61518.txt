NCD: Multiple problems when inner equals outer element type	"To reproduce set inner element type equal to outer element type. Path via ""subordinate"" Nest inner by subordinate.

See here for an afected configuration:

First problem:

Outer element filter (only tried with text filters) removes all elements, even if they should stay in the diagram. Effect occurs immediately after first key stroke.



Second problem, probably related:

Inner element filter (only tried with text filters) does not have any effect



Expected in both cases:

Correct filtering of the appropriate elements, no effect on other elements"		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Oct/15 12:59 PM	28/Oct/15 4:03 PM														"27/Oct/15 10:48 AM;fka;Nesting inner / outer now (still?) broken



To reproduce: 

Set inner type and outer type to Business Domain. Path ""Subordinate Business Domain"". Inner nest by ""Superordinate..."".

1. Then select outer nest by ""superordinate..."" -> no effect

2. Then select outer nest by ""subordinate ..."" -> inner nest is changed, outer nest stays the same



Excepted:

Nesting applied as selected
