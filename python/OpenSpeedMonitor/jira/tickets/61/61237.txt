Building Block List Filter not transferred to LSD	"When the LSD is loaded from the Building Block List (via the button ""Show Landscape diagram"" on top), the filter on the list is not transferred correctly to the diagram. In the list, the search filter looks into both the name as well as description of an item while the filter in the diagram filter seems to check only the name (says ""Name like ..."" in the diagram legend). This means, less items are shown in the diagram than selected by the list.



For the status filter in case of e.g. Information Systems, the LSD is empty, because also here the filter is applied to the item's name in the diagram (e.g. ""Name like CURRENT"")."

- status filter works now in lsd and ncd

- the first problem cannot be solved yet (cause we dont have OR filter). I created a ticket for later. "	"02/Nov/15 4:36 PM;tam;The same fix also for ITERAPLAN-4033



The parameters handling contains two more or less equivalent switch block, but since it's not final solution, it's good enough."
