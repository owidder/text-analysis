Hide empty columns correctly	"Currently, even if ""hide empty columns"" is selected, empty columns can be shown if the horizontal axis is displayed hierarchically.

It happens in case that the empty column belongs to an axis element which has subordinate axis elements that are displayed.



This behavior is intended for rows to be able to represent the hierarchical structure of the axis without layouting issues, but is not necessary for columns.



Please change according to attached sketch."		Bug	iteraplan PO	24/Oct/15 4:11 PM	04/Nov/15 1:49 PM														03/Nov/15 9:53 AM;dam;didnÂ´t create tests. tablebuilder-spec is excluded
