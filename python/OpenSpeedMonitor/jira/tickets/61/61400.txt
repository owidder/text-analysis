Cannot change content filter on empty result set	"_Reproduce:_

* Go to LSD in interactive client

* Set a content filter with empty result set, for example ""name = 'zzz'""

* Apply filter and close dialog



_Expected:_ Empty diagram displayed, with axis descriptions. Axis and Content tool areas open on clicking the according diagram parts



_Actual:_ Content tool area does not open"		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/Oct/15 11:55 AM	28/Oct/15 8:55 AM														"27/Oct/15 9:42 AM;lwi;complete content tool area now opens when there is no content to show and you click on the empty diagram (content area only). if you click again the toolarea is hidden again. 



solved by adding a new transparent block where the content is usually shown.

as agreed with Marcel, no unit test is written as it would cost to much time (Release is near and other testcases aren't green)



Fixed another bug with this ticket: there was no ""No elements to display"" message in NCD TILL NOW :) 

 

tested in Chrome, IE, Firefox"
