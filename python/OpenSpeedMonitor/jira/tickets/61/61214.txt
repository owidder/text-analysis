IFD Filter for date didn´t work	"*Reproduce*

Add a ""Development(Start) in filterdialog. Then change the date attribute to ""Development(End)"" without leaving the dialog (do so by fully clearing the attribute field. This Bug will

not occur if only say the last letters of ""Development(Start)"" are deleted to have the dropdown menu show ""Development(End)"") add values in Development(End). 



*Expect*

a new Development(End) filter will set



*Actual*

nothing happen. the page doesn´t reload after entering values.





maybe dialog didn´t reload after attribute change. after reset min&max date the new filter will accept"		Bug	iteraplan PO	23/Oct/15 10:23 AM	28/Oct/15 2:49 PM														28/Oct/15 1:45 PM;msr;Please refactor with "switch-case". Thanks.
