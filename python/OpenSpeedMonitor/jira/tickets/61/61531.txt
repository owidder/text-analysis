Download standard output file of reactor doesnt work automatically	"Select ""publicDemo_simpleInfoFlow.xsl"" with no other files shown under ""All files"" -> Start Reactor



Result:

iteraplan.xml is not downloaded automatically although it is created among other files under ""All files""



Expected:

iteraplan.xml is downloaded automatically

"		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Oct/15 3:51 PM	28/Oct/15 2:07 PM					download	reactor								"28/Oct/15 12:50 PM;lwi;the iteraplan.xml that should be downloaded couldn't be found, because the list containing the file was refreshed after the file was searched (and not before). fixed it with a little workaround. 





there is already a unit test (everything still green).
