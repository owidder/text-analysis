LSD Show empty columns doesnt work	"could not reproduce with bank data:

- Start (EON Data) in LSD

- Change x-Axis Relation to ""Connected Business Unit""

- ""Content Filter"" - ""Add new Filter"" - ""Description"" - ""aa""

- ""Settings"" - ""Show empty columns""



result: 

- nothing is visible

- at the bottom there is a scrollbar

- legend visible and correct



expected:

- empty columns are shown



reasons:

- canvas have limited sizes and areas (see http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6081483/maximum-size-of-a-canvas-element )

- the diagram that should be constructed in the case above exceeds this max size for width (depends on browser how much this is)





possible solutions:

- propably good but expensive: split the big canvas into several smaller canvas which represent the whole diagram when combined

- quick and dirty: cut the canvas if size is too big. e.g. at function draw in lsdTableBuilder.js (this will make the canvas visible at least; tested in chrome):

        diagram.div.style.width = Math.round(bounds.width > 32767 ? 32767 : bounds.width) + 'px';

        diagram.div.style.height = Math.round(bounds.height > 32767 ? 32767 : bounds.height) + 'px';"		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Oct/15 3:45 PM	30/Oct/15 6:07 AM					column	lsd								29/Oct/15 4:26 PM;lwi;solution -> quick and dirty: please test with eon data in all browsers
