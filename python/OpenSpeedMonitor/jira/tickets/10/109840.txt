Prohibit pinning of columns in the BBT-List	"After adding too many columns in the Building Block List, it is possible to drag a column right of the Actions-column. This dragged column is also pinned.



Prohibit this behaviour.



Please consult [~aan] and [~sfe] about their first ideas."		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	27/Jan/17 4:46 PM	15/Feb/17 3:32 PM														"15/Feb/17 3:08 PM;aan;For the reviewer:

There is already a solution implemented for this problem. It checks if the second last column in the colums configuration is the actions column and in this case it switches these two columns. This is only working if the actions column is also the last in the configuration, which is implemented here."
