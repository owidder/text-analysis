History json does not distinguish by change type for business mapping changes	"_Reproduce:_

# In classic client, with active history, open an information system that has at least one business mapping

# Edit

# Delete that business mapping

# Add a new business mapping between the same elements as the deleted one had

# Save

# View history in interactive client



_Expected:_ A history change where the same business mapping is reported as removed and added

_Actual:_ Only one of the two is shown"		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Oct/16 12:58 PM	26/Oct/16 1:37 PM
