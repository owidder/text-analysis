Limit number of elements in the Navigator	"Limit: If there are more than 200 (200 for IE, 500 for other browsers) elments on the screen (save it in a constant), make the next element on the path as route element and hide the old route element. Test the limits, if they are correct.



Count every box and every group in the diagram (and *not* the underlying Business Objects).

{color:red}Update{color} We count maximum possible visible elements to calculate the limit. So, we count each group as one element. Also, in scope of IPTS-414, only one group can be expanded in each moment. So, for items we find the group with maximum number of items and count them all. For other groups we count either maximum visible items (six) or actual number of items in case if this number is less than six."
