thank you for your inquiry.

Could you please send me a screenshot which error in the console appears, when the migration tool stops? 
In the log-file this error is missing and makes the analys very hard.

We checked the error message + log files. Could you please replace the ""historyMigrationTool.jar"" from the following ZIP-File on your Server.



https://www.iteraplan.de/downloads/basis/iteraplan-historyMigrationTool-bshq.zip 



After that, use the timestamp before the first migration and start the migraion again.

The user name and password is the same as the orginal ""History Migration Tool"".
