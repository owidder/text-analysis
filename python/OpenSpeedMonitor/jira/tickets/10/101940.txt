Few comments related to Creole formatting for description field in the List:

- when adding *heading* formatting - height of description cell is incorrect and bottom part is just cut;

E.g.:

{code}

= Heading 1 =

== Heading 2 ==

=== Heading 3 ===

==== Heading 4 ====

{code}

- same is for *lists* (numbered lists).

E.g.:

{code}

# item1

## item11

# item2

{code}"	09/Feb/17 4:16 PM;roia;Updated the height calculation
