thank you for your inquiry. 

Could you please check following points:

# Clear your Browser Cache and Cookies 
# On the path ""[TOMCAT7]\work\Catalina\localhost\"" clear the iteraplan instance folder
# Are the upgrade scripts of the database correctly executed ? In Version 5.4 the database must have the table ""REACTOR_SCRIPT_CONFIG"".

You can check the Reactor testwise on a other system. Are there the same problems?

Greetings,
