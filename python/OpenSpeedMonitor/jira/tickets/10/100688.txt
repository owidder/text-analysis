SavedQuery does not save keys without values in the url	"*Summary:*

SavedQuery does not save keys without values in the url



*Reproduce:*

Example is IFD:

* Open default IFD

* Click on Settings\Include IS connected over an IF

* URL is extended with parameter ""&includingConnectedIS""

* Save query

* Load query



*Actual:*

* Setting is deactivated



*Expected:*

* Setting is still activated



*Idea:*

URL-parameter does not match the pattern ""key = value"""		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Oct/16 4:24 PM	02/Nov/16 8:28 AM														"26/Oct/16 4:55 PM;roia;*Quick workaround:* instead of saving boolean value, save the numeric value, e.g. 1:

{code}

    this.changeISConnectedOverInterfaceSwitch = function () {

        this.configurationParameters.includingConnectedIS = !this.configurationParameters.includingConnectedIS;

        this.updateConfiguration({includingConnectedIS: this.configurationParameters.includingConnectedIS ? 1: null}); //here we save numeric ""1"" instead of boolean ""true""

    };

{code}



*Proper fix:* we may need to save boolean values in saved queries, so the SavedQuery service should handle this situation properly"	31/Oct/16 11:50 AM;mse;When the URL is deserialized to build the saved query or when a safed query is serialized to URL, boolean values are now treated separately.
