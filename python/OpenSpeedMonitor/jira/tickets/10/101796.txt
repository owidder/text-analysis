User Settings for Query Console	"*Summary:*

* {color:red}Update: {color} Save to URL *only query string that had been executed last* (by pressing 'send query' button or executed from the list) *with successful (not failed) status* as user setting in the database (after 1 minute or when changing the route).

* When do user opens the url or navigates back to the iteraQl-tile, the characters are automatically entered in the input field; {color:red}Update: {color} Copy them to the input field

* The user can ""Reset View"" to reset the user setting and url

* Use the existing implementation in all diagrams as template"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	07/Nov/16 4:02 PM	20/Jan/17 2:25 PM														"06/Dec/16 3:04 PM;madu;Concerning the first requirement point - I doubt it's a good idea to save everything in the URL that had been *just typed* into input field. 

My suggestion is to expose to URL *only query string that had been executed last* (by pressing 'send query' button or executed from the list) *with successful (not failed) status* as it doesn't make sense to me to save a query string which wasn't verified by execution.



On the second point please clarify: when user comes with queryText in URL saved - is queryText *immediately executed* or it's *just copied* to the the input field?



Additionaly as user settings come into play - please confirm that we should save issued queries history there. I suggest no limitation on query history size list within user settings."	20/Dec/16 7:48 AM;madu;#5519	26/Dec/16 5:24 PM;madu;#5566	29/Dec/16 4:06 PM;mash;Review comments: User settings are not working when opening Query Console from Saved Queries (see screenshot) 	18/Jan/17 1:20 PM;msr;Already started by [~madu] .
