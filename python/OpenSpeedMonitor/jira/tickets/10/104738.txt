make every line of CRUD line editable and apply the change to corresponding ISR2BO instance.



possible solutuion: detect on click, which line is affected, show the editorfor this line (overline starting on this line)



the same principle will be used for other ""multiline cells"""		Improvement	iteraplan Thunderduck	05/Dec/16 3:22 PM	11/Jan/17 3:11 PM
