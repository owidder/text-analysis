Long URL as URL-ID (client)	"*Summary:*

Create a new service to save and load long urls as URL-IDs in the database



*Details*

* Only save the parameters (after the ""?"") if they are longer than 1800 characters

* If the parameters are longer than 1800 characters, save and load them as url-id from the server

* Implement this new service in all parts of the application



Check, if this new mechanism works correctly together with the saved queries



*Interactions to save a url-ID:*

* Check, if parameter length is longer than 1800

* If yes, {{POST}} the parameters to {{/api/urlParams}}

{code:java}

{

  ""urlParams"": ""URL-PARAMETERS""

}

{code}

* The server responds with {{200}} and the content 

{code:java}

{

  ""urlParamId"": ""XXXXXX"",

  ""urlParams"": ""URL-PARAMETERS""}

{code}

* The client writes to the url {{#/ROUTE?urlParamId=XXXXXX}}



*Interactions to load a url-ID:*

* If the url contains the parameter {{urlParamId}} send a {{GET}}-Request to {{/api/urlParams/\{urlParamId\}}}

* The server responds with {{200}} and the content 

{code:java}

{

  ""urlParams"": ""URL-PARAMETERS""

}

{code}

* These returned url-parameters are used for the configuration, but the url still shows {{#/ROUTE?urlParamId=XXXXXX}}



*Interactions to update a url-ID:*

* If a url needs to be updated, which contains the parameter {{urlParamId}} send a {{PUT}}-Request with the following body to {{/api/urlParams/\{urlParamId\}}}

{code:java}

{

  ""urlParams"": ""URL-PARAMETERS""

}

{code}

* The server responds with {{204}}"		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	08/Dec/16 11:19 AM	16/May/17 12:54 PM														"04/May/17 1:35 PM;dmkh;Review is done, almost all possible cases are checked: [https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-561]
