Create a login screen for the New Client	"*Summary:*

Create a new login screen for the New Client.



*Details:*

* Link http://SERVER/iteraplan/ to new client login-page

* route #/login

* Rebuild login.jsp from classic client

* Exception handling is in scope of IPTS-331

* Send same login-action as classic client does

* After successfull login go to http://SERVER/iteraplan/client/#/home

* No reset-password-link

* Show exceptions as red banners, same messages like in the classic client

* In case of wrong credentials, please leave the content in the text input fields



*UI:*

* Similar to login.jsp from classic client, but in Angular Materials Design (no Bootstrap) (see [^classic_client_login.png])

* iteraplan-icon at the top

* ""iteraplan 5"" as headline

* {color:red}UPDATE:{color} Use constant for default language for localisation if no url-parameter is set

* localised ""Username:"" + Text-Input-Field

* localised ""Password:"" + Password-Input-Field (shows dots instead of characters)

* {color:red}UPDATE:{color} Password is a required field

* Login-Button

* {color:red}UPDATE: {color}-Links to iteratec and iteraplan-

* {color:red}UPDATE: {color} No ""*"" after username

* {color:red}UPDATE: {color} Instead of ""iteraplan 5"" show actual release number e.g. ""5.4""



*Refactoring:*

* Do not perform REST-calls for metamodel, data model for login-page.

* -Do not load localisation service ""staticFileLoader"" for login page- Load only static translation data for login page, but not medatata.

* No unit tests for angular components

lots of words there, but the general result is:

{quote}browser doesn't allow you to handle 302 on your own.{quote}

{quote}XMLHttpRequest object (according to the standard) must automatically handle redirection without giving the client code a chance to do anything about it.{quote}



So it would be better to update the backend than finding not very nice workarounds on frontend to work with the current version of backend.

Suggestions: 

* don't allow user to enter login page after authentication(redirect to home page or show some message etc.);

* perform login by ""Enter"" button click

* set autofocus on username input field"	"19/Dec/16 10:56 AM;roia;{quote}
