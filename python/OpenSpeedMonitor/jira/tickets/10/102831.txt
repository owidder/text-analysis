Use component in ag-grid editor for text and num 	" see IPTT-220

the implemented structure should be refactored accordinig to IPTT-204 (do not manipulate DOM only, create and use common edit component)"		Improvement	iteraplan Thunderduck	17/Nov/16 1:27 PM	25/Nov/16 8:41 AM														"18/Nov/16 9:44 AM;mse;Comment from sprint review:



* Numbers should be entered in the correct format for the selected language, i.e.

** English: ""10000.5"", so point is used to separate the decimal places

** German: ""10.000,5"", so comma is used to separate the decimal places and the point to make blocks of 3 digits clearer must be treated correctly"	24/Nov/16 2:11 PM;aan;Clicking outside the cell or using enter and co leads to stopping the edit-mode, but the new value is not send. This leads to "undefined" as new value, which leads to a invalid json and an error at the server	24/Nov/16 2:33 PM;mse;The new value is now updated whenever the user changes the content of the input field. So editing succeeds also when it is finished via Enter key or clicking out of the cell.
