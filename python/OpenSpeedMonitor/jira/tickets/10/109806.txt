Clean up line type selection in LSD	"Currently, property selection for line type in LSD uses a mixture of the {{metamodel.attributes}} data and the {{type.properties}} data. However, for diagrams, only {{type.properties}} should be used.



To do:

# If necessary, add fields like {{rangeValues}} and {{unit}} to the objects in type.properties, during metamodel creation and fill them with values from the attributes data.

# Replace {{metamodel.attributes}} with {{type.properties}} in LSD line type configuration and the according tool area view model builder."
