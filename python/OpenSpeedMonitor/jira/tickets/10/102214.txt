Crawling iteraplan content	"Dear iterpaplan support, 



as we want to integerate iteraplan into our companyinteral search, our colleagues tried to crawl the iteraplan content.

What they are doing is to send HTTP-requests to our iteraplan instance (Tomcat with an IIS in front). The search system is a Sharepoint 2013. 



What they are getting back is an unrecognized HTTP reponse. 



Do you have any expierience with crawling iteraplan content? 





Thanks in advance. 

BR,

thank you for your inquiry.

The REST interface of iteraplan need a authentification via cookie or REST command. 
Would you please check following links:

https://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan54/REST+API
https://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan54/Automating+Data+Export+and+Import (For Basic Authentifications)

It's not possible to use LDAP / SSO for the authentification of REST. 

Additional we have no experience with Sharepoint 2013 and crawling with REST in iteraplan. 
At the moment it is not possible to use the search of iteraplan with REST.

We are planing to publish this in a future version. 

Greetings,

Christoph Stangl - iteraplan Support "	"14/Nov/16 11:42 AM;benedikt.schmaler@bshg.com;Hi Mr. Stangl,

I cant find it in the documentation. 

thanks, "	"14/Nov/16 11:47 AM;cst;Hi Mr. Schmaler,



thanks for your reply.



In our example for ""Automating Data Export and Import"" the authentication is described in following part:



Example for ""form""-based authentication with cookies:



#Login

*curl -k -v --data ""j_username=<USERNAME>&j_password=<PASSWORD>"" <ITERAPLAN_URL>/j_iteraplan_security_check --cookie-jar cookies.txt*



#Command 

*curl -X POST -k -v --cookie cookies.txt* and the rest of your comamnd.



Greetings,
