- hint message(tooltip) for disabled ""Tree view"" button (to notify user if there are only single hierarchy level elements in the current Building Block type);

- show info-message for user when missing ""Name"" column was added to the tree view list."	30/Mar/17 4:06 PM;dmkh;For reviewer: updated user Guide documentation for BB list - [https://doc.iteraplan.de/display/iteraplan60/List+view]	"03/Apr/17 9:02 PM;mash;Next bug appeared:



steps to reproduce:

 * Open IS list

 * in quickfilter type ""CO"" -> 4 items are shown  !Screenshot_1.png|width=547,height=136!

 * press tree view button -> second element dissapeared. Appeared parent element is not in grey.

 * Refresh page -> Parent element is grey, we still don't see dissapeared element.



Switching back to list view bring this element back."	04/Apr/17 2:03 PM;dmkh;[~mash],after clarifying with [~msr] we decided to disable quickfilter for tree view till the Ag-grid issue will not be fixed (there is a feature request to fix it https://github.com/ceolter/ag-grid/issues/1572)	05/Apr/17 10:44 AM;mash;Review is done
