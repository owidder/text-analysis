Filter Extension: Filter by Business Mapping	"*Summary:*

Filter Extension: Filter by (a complete) Business Mapping (and not the separate parts of it)



*Details:*

* Re-Implement filter functionality of classic client for Business Mappings

* Filter by all attributes of the related Business Mapping and all attributes of Business Processes, Business Units and Products (if you have selected an Information System as basis)

* Filter by ""No Associations""



{color:red}UPDATE: {color} Don't include watchers.



(CHANGE) marks behaviour which is different in the classic client

BM = Business Mapping



General maxim: The semantic of clauses is ""there exists at least one which...."", not ""all fufill the criteria""!



*(New) Behaviour in detail:*

* global option ""No associations"": Elements fullfill this option, if they have no BM at all

* (CHANGE) 4 clauses (attributes of BM and 3 relations to other ends of the BM) are connected by AND

* (CHANGE) New Option ""No associations"" for each of the 3 relations end points. Elements fullfil this condition, if they have at least one BM, which has this end point not set. Cp. the maxim above.

* With the 3 end point clauses: <Some attibute>/<some operator>: Elements do not fulfill this condition, if the respective endpoint is not set.

(CHANGE) ""No value""/""is not""/""contains not"" behavior in the old client was different, as the empty relation end point was modelled differently

* With the 3 end points: For each end point 3 different options should be available: (1) ""Don't care"", (2) ""No Associations"", (3) ""According to the following clauses""

(1) This corresponds to not adding a relation filter extension in the classic filter dialog. With the BM filter the 3 end points are always visible, so ""not adding"" the clause is not possible. We have to explicitely add this option.

(2) Cp. above, new option

(3) Only in this case the clauses are shown. Filtering as in the standard filter dialog resp. see above.

Default is (1)

Maybe some radio button options (left to right) might be useful for providing these three options. Ideas are welcome ;-)

Captions: (1) ""Any"" / ""Beliebig"" (2) ... (3) ""According to attributes"" / ""Entsprechend der Eigenschaften""

"	04/Jan/17 10:15 AM;roia;Assigning this to Fabian to confirm that filtering logic works as it should. From my point of view, it works correct.	13/Jan/17 1:36 PM;dmkh;[~fka], [~roia], [~msr], I have noticed strange duplicates in relations list of filter dialog for Information Systems (see attached screenshots). This issue probably appeared after changes related to this ticket.	13/Jan/17 4:16 PM;fka;[~dmkh] Duplicates not visible in nightly build. Therefore some other change from today might be responsible for the duplicates. Please open a separate defect ticket.	13/Jan/17 4:16 PM;fka;[~roia] Filtering logic works as expected! Thanks.
