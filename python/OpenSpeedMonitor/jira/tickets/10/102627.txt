Problem with Nested Cluster and Show in the classic Client 	"After following setup, the button ""Show in classic Client"" jumps to the Nested Cluster diagram in the classic client.



# Open the interactive Client

# Open the Nested Cluster diagram

# Click on the iteraplan logo 

# Click on ""Show in classic Client"" 

# The classic client opens in the Nested Cluster diagram (classic) 



Expected: After clicking on ""Show in classic Client"" the iteraplan start screen of the classic client appears 

Actually:  After clicking on ""Show in classic Client"" the Nested Cluster diagram opens in the classic client"		Bug	iteraplan PO	15/Nov/16 3:38 PM	07/Dec/16 10:05 AM
