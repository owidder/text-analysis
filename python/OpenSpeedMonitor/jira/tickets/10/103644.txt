Excuse me, but I don't think this comment is applicable here as we don't provide mentioned features for ""bindingSet"" & ""synthetic"".



Please, specify some applicable arguments"	27/Dec/16 4:01 PM;madu;As per today's discussion with Fabian - no link to single element view should be provided within columns for result types "bindingSet" & "synthetic", no export & quick search features, just two raw tables.
