Handle add/remove assoc. relations	"follow up ticket for IPTT-295



* When adding/removing an assoc. relation, all cells of the edited row in the column group of the assoc. relation should be locked for edit until the server responds to the edit request.

* There is a bug where the server does not completely include changes of added/removed assoc. relations in the response to an edit request. this has to be fixed.
