Response for change of parent via Microedit PUT is wrong	"There is a problem with the element API. This causes a problem when the list is edited because the datamodel in the new client is not updated correctly.



Send PUT request to /api/element/InformationSystem/{ID} and remove a parent for an IS with parent

* you can use the following request body:

{code}

{parent: []}

{code}



The answer looks like:



{code}

{

	""success"": true,

	""changes"": {

		""InformationSystem"": [{

			""id"": 221,

			""changeType"": ""UPDATE"",

			""changedValues"": {

				""lastModificationTime"": ""2016-12-01T09:34:09.220+01:00""

			}

		},

		{

			""id"": 207,

			""changeType"": ""UPDATE"",

			""changedValues"": {

				""children"": {

					""removed"": [221]

				}

			}

		}]

	}

}

{code}



*Expected:*



The change of parent is included in the changes for IS 221.



*Actual:*



There is no change of parent mentioned -> The change is not applied to the datamodel of the new client
