Partial message sometimes displays wrong numbers	"_Reproduce:_

# Change partial limit for LSD in constants js, for example to ""10""

# Start iteraplan and navigate to LSD

_Expected:_ Partial message stating that only the first 10 elements are displayed

_Actual:_ Partial message stating that only the first 1000 elements are displayed"		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	11/Jan/17 8:01 AM	11/Jan/17 8:58 AM
