Refactor cell renderes for list view	"We use a cell renderer for all list columns which displays an additional edit button besides the content of the cell (see Renderers.js).



The only exception are relationship columns which use a cell template instead of a cell renderer (compare ListColumnDefsBuilder.js, line 124). So for relationship columns there is no edit button at the moment.



*Task:*

* Refactor cell template into a cell renderer which includes the edit button and use it for relationship columns

* If feasible on a reasonable timescale: refactor the StringCellRenderer in Renderers.js as the code is a bit chaotic there."
