Create skeleton with basic functionality	"*Summary:*

Create a new ""diagram"" - the ""Navigator""



*Non-functional requirements:*

* No tile in the homescreen *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* Scrolling with GoJS-features (initially diagram size restricted to screen size) *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* No partiality as if more than 200 elements are open, the first are closed

* Loading indicator *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* Include report date in legend *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* Legend slide in and out *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* Static Toolarea *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* Save configuration in the url *{color:green}DONE{color}*



*Functional requirements:*

* Link from Single Element View: ""Show in Navigator"" / German: ""Zeige im Navigator"" and use attached icon *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* Link from each row of the Building Block List: Put the attached icon in the action column *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* Place the route element in the center of the screen *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* Set the background color of the cell for all Building Blocks on the screen by the typesDefinition *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* -Starting from the first element show initially all related Building Blocks as colored boxes and link them to the route element *{color:green}DONE{color}*-

* Starting from the first element show initially all related Building Blocks as colored boxes within groups of Building Block Types *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* Create one link from the first element to the group (and *not* to the Building Blocks) *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* Do not show arrows, just lines (no directions) *{color:green}DONE{color}*



*Groups:*

* Every related Building Block Type and every single Self-Relation-Type (e.g. ""Parent"") are separate groups *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* Every group has as title the localised name of the Relationship-End *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* The background of the group is grey color *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* The group consits of all related Building Blocks of this type (or of this self-relation) *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* These elements are colored boxes (see above) one below the other *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* Within the group the elements are ordered alphabetically by their -localised- name *{color:green}DONE{color}*

* The group has a maximum height (maximum height shows 6 elements)

* -If there are more than 6 elements within a group, a scrollbar at the right side of the group appears and the user can scroll within the group-



* Legend:

** ""Start Element"": Name of this Building Block / German: ""Start-Element:"" Name of this Building Block *{color:green}DONE{color}*

- Please ensure the layout is deterministic, i.e. the diagram looks always the same, if the model has not changed (= if the user opens the diagram with CRM 3.1 as a route one day and opens the same diagram with CRM 3.1 as a route on another day, all boxes are on the same positions.) *{color:green}DONE{color}*

"	25/Nov/16 3:11 PM;msr;I've sent the question to GoJS regarding the grouping of related elements. Let's wait for their answer.	"25/Nov/16 4:35 PM;msr;GoJS advises to use the Group templates. That sounds reasonable to me. Please check that:

""Well, that might work.  But why not just add those Nodes into separate Groups?  The Group template need not even have any visible elements – just a Placeholder – if you don’t want it to be seen as a “group”.  Then the Group.layout can be whatever you want.

""We don't offer a built-in way for you to scroll the members of a Group.



I suppose you could use the ""ScrollingTable"" Panel and repurpose it to work on the members of the group rather than on the elements of a Panel, which it controls by setting Panel.topIndex.



Basically you would need to replace setting Panel.topIndex with making all of the member nodes not  GraphObject.visible except for a limited number that will fit, which would be visible.
