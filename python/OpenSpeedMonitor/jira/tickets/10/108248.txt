Filter: Undo-Button is not working	"*Summary:*

Undo-Button is just closing and not cancelling



*Expected behaviour:*

* When clicking on ""Undo"", all *newly entered* filter-items are removed

** this is done by saving the url, when the filter-dialog is opened and restoring it after clicking on ""undo""
