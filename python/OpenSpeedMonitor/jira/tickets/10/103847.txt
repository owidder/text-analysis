NCD: Not reachable Building Blocks for special permission configurations	"*Summary:*

For special permission configurations (""islands""), e.g. only permission for Business Domain + Business Process and Architecture Domain + Technical Component, it is not possible to reach the other Building Block Type as inner or outer element.



*Explanation:""

* The toolarea for inner and outer elements only shows ""connected"" (over two steps connected) Building Block Types.

* For certain permissions for Building Block Types the following can happen:

** the inital diagram starts with one Building Block Type

** You can choose all connected Building Block Types from the Toolarea

** But if some Building Block Types in between are missing, it is not possible to reach all Building Block Types



{color:red}UPDATE: {color} Please implement the following solution: If the user does not have all Building Block-Type permissions, show all available (not only connected ones) Building Block Types as outer elements."
