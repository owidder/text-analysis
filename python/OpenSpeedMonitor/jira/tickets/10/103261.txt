Saved Query and XSL creating a Error in Reactor 5.4	"When you want to use a Saved Query on XSL Data an Error appears:

de.iteratec.iteraplan.common.error.IteraplanTechnicalException: The saved query contains illegal data or you do not possess the required permissions for all contained Buildingblocks or Attributes

I checked it with different scripts,  Queries and iteraplan 5.4 installations. After check in the box for using Saved Query, the XSL Data cannot be executed. In the nightly instance of iteraplan, is the problem is the same. 

#  Open reactor in the interactive client 
#  Upload the file ""TESTScript.xsl"" from --\tests\manualTests\Reactor (new client repo)
# Use the ID from the Query  ""Future information systems"" 

Expected: The XSL with Saved Query will be executed 
Current: The XSL with Saved Query  will not be executed "		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	21/Nov/16 11:24 AM	12/Dec/16 4:08 PM														30/Nov/16 6:34 PM;mwe;First findings: The UserContext is missing in the ScriptExecuterTask and so the user misses the needed locale and the needed rights.	"01/Dec/16 1:08 PM;mwe;To inject the SecurityContext into the call() method use the following:

In de.iteratec.iteraplan.businesslogic.service.xslt.ScriptExecuterTask:

replace

{code}

future = executor.submit(task);

{code}

with

{code}

DelegatingSecurityContextExecutorService delegatingSecurityContextExecutorService = new DelegatingSecurityContextExecutorService(executor, SecurityContextHolder.getContext());

future = delegatingSecurityContextExecutorService.submit(task);

{code}



But this is not needed for this issue. Scripts can be executed with the Supervisor role so I created a temporary UserContext with the SuperVisor role."	"01/Dec/16 4:40 PM;mwe;There is a validation of dates and numbers corresponding to the locale: 

de.iteratec.iteraplan.model.xml.query.QPartXML: lines 183 and 190



I contacted Daniel Neuer to get a script that uses dates and numbers to verify the issue."	"12/Dec/16 4:04 PM;mwe;Tested the script test_dateFormat.xsl with the connected saved query ""Future Information Systems"" and got the same output for english and german language.

In [^output.zip] you find the results of iteraplan 5.3. In 5.3 the results are the same, too. So no bug in version 5.3 and the bug in 5.4 is fixed."
