Deletion of log and index directories uses wrong location	"When log and index directories are to be deleted, the application looks for them within the tomcat installation directory right now.

These directories are configured as property though, and per default not within the tomcat installation directory, that's why they are not actually cleaned up at the moment."	93358	Sub-task	iteraplan Speedbird	02/Nov/16 10:28 AM	03/Nov/16 3:41 PM
