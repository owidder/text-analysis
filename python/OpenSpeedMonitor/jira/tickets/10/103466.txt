Layout for small window sizes	"*Summary:*

If the window size gets too small, the responsive layout for attribute groups looks strange, similar to a diagonal (see screenshot).

Please correct this layout and ensure every column is filled ""from the top"".



Is Bootstrap used (Bootstrap is deprecated for iteraplan and will be replaced by Angular Materials)?"		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	22/Nov/16 3:32 PM	20/Dec/16 9:44 AM														06/Dec/16 4:01 PM;msr;Please consult [~mwe] for problems with bower. Thanks.

I'd prefer that items in the Relations-sections, which are links to single element views, looked more like links (underlined, some blue undertone). [~msr], could you please give your input on this."	19/Dec/16 11:42 AM;msr;In the nightly build the links look in some Magenta color without any underlining (see screenshot). That's ok for me.	"19/Dec/16 11:44 AM;roia;[~msr], please see the attached items-glued-together.jpg. The ""Proprietary DB # 2.0"" and ""SOAP"" are actually different items, but it is not clear from the UI and they look like one item.

I think, we should make some UI updates to distinguish different items (maybe, have different background for even/odd items, increase right or margin...) or something else."	"19/Dec/16 1:46 PM;roia;[~vadm], OK, accourding to discussion above just move inline styles to CSS and for the items, which are very close to each other we'll create follow-up task, if [~msr] finds it necessary.



[~msr], for the link styles I mean that they are different than, for example, links in the ipList component, which get underlined on mouse hover."	"19/Dec/16 2:33 PM;roia;The section title jumps up then section is collapsed. Please check if it's our issue, or the issue of angular-material component and create follow-up ticket if necessary
