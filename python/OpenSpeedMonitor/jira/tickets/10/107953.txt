Quick Filter fails with grouped attribute columns	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_

# In interactive client, open list view for Information Systems

# Add ""Relation to Business Objects"" column group

# Add ""Relation IS-BO - CRUD""

# Type anything in quick search



Problem: quick filter doesn't work



Possible reason: Cells in attribute columns inside column groups can contain an Array of Arrays, and the search function might have to be adjusted for this case."		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	10/Jan/17 4:57 PM	16/Jan/17 10:23 AM
