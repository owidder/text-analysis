Columns width will be ignored if description column has been removed	"What happens?

If you remove the description column, the suppressSizeToFit=false will be removed with the description column, so all columns will be spread over the full grid size ignoring their default widths.



How to fix?

If the column with suppressSizeToFit=false is deleted another column has to get the suppressSizeToFit=false value.
