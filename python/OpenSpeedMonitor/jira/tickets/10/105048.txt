Migration for Landscape Diagram			New Feature	iteraplan Thunderduck	08/Dec/16 4:33 PM	01/Feb/17 8:03 AM														"26/Jan/17 4:30 PM;sfe;The only thing I've noticed (aside from bugs with hierarchical filters which have their own ticket), is regarding the line type:

* If ""Status"" is selected as line type, it is not migrated.

* I don't understand the log message for line type migration. Currently it says, for each migrated diagram:

{{Feature Landscape Diagram was migrated with Note: Line types for border lines are not migrated.}}

What does that mean? Especially since border line types *are* migrated with the exception of ""Status"" mentioned above."	26/Jan/17 5:37 PM;ants;[~sfe], please, see attachments.	"27/Jan/17 8:40 AM;sfe;Thank you for the quick reply.

* Status for line types seems to work on the current nightly build, see screenshot [^status-border.png]. Maybe it is a recent change?

* I understand now what you meant with the Line Type migration log message. It's easy to misunderstand without that additional information, though.

Please change the message as follows: {{Feature Line Type by \[attribute name\] was migrated with Note: Line styles look different}}"
