Cannot create new index	"Hi,



After upgrading from 5.0 to 5.4, the quick search utility was no longer working. 



I tried to select ""Create new index"" as well as ""purge index before rebuilding"", however I receive the following error ""Could not get property value"". I've attached the Anonymized problem report that the error page allows me to generate."

thank you for your inquiry.

Could you please check following points:

# Go into the menue ""Administration"" - ""Configuration"" and click on the button ""Clear Cache""
# On the path ""[TOMCAT7]\work\Catalina\localhost\"" clear the iteraplan instance folder
# Clear the the index path, which was defined in the setup of iteraplan
# Restart you TOMCAT Server 
# As last step, create the index again

When the error shown up again, we need the iteraplan.log and the catalina.log for the next analyse steps.

I've followed these steps and attached the log files.

As stated in my other ticket, we cannot provide a dump of the database.

I will try running the new migration tool to see if this resolves the issue.

we have loacated the problem with the creation of the index.

The reason is a problem with a older versions of Oracle 12c. There is a bug which has been fixed in newer versions. 
Could you please check following ""Trouble Shooting"" Articel we created for this problem:
