Validation for input fields of numeric filter	"1. Please, add validation for input fields of numeric filter (only numbers can be typed with one dot (or comma for German) separator).

2. Additionally check if dots/commas are localized and displayed correctly for German/English (currently user cannot type comma when German language is chosen).

3. Add a *delay of 3 seconds* after typing a character before applying the number of the input box, i.e. before applying the filter in the background and the synchronisation between the second input field and the first input field.
