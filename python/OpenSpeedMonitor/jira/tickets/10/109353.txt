Undefined value displayed wrongly when coloring by Accountability	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_

# Unset the value for ""Accountability"" of ""CRM # 3.1""

# Define a Cluster Diagram with the header ""Attribute->Complexity"" and a row ""Information System""

# Choose as coloring for Information System ""Accountability""



_Expected:_ CRM # 3.1 displayed in the ""undefined"" color

_Actual:_ CRM # 3.1 is displayed in black



Also:

* When using Information Systems as header and coloring the header according to Accountability, CRM # 3.1 is not the undefined color, but the default header color

* Similarly, when configuring a Masterplan Diagram for Information Systems as Level 1 elements, and the Level 1 coloring is for Accountability CRM # 3.1 is not displayed as the undefined color, but white."
