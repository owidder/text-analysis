He thinks, it was used long time ago to ensure that 1-character-strings with special characters are not allowed, because we used this special characters for things like ""AND"", ""OR"" and so on...

So, you can remove the function almost completely except for one case: the empty string. Please ensure, that when handing over an empty string, you get an empty result set (either directly by lucence or this function)."	"08/Dec/16 5:11 PM;ants;Reviews done:
