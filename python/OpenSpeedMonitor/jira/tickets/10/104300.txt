thank you for your inquiry. 

Would you please give me Name of our customer (or is Conoco a abbreviation)
After that, I prepare the next steps for you. 

Greetings,

The first step is to update the database from version 3.4.1 to 5.3.

In this ZIP-Achive you will find all upgrade scripts for that. 



[^Scripts.zip]



Please note, its important to update the database in a row. 

 

After that, you can download /install the version 5.3 Basis from this link:

The first execution script it takes an error:

migration_iteraplan_340_to_500_mysql.sql
ERROR 1146 (42S02) at line 11: Table 'ip_conoco.BBT' doesn't exist

also second script error:

repair_pos_columns_34_mysql.sqlrepair_pos_columns_34_mysql.sql

ERROR 1146 (42S02) at line 44: Table 'ip_conoco.AD' doesn't exist

Please provide the propertly scripts or let us know how we continue, Thanks

I stopped here"	"07/Dec/16 8:27 AM;cst;Good Morning,

is the table BBT and AD in the database available? 

When these are missing, you cannot have installed the Version 3.4.1.
That's the reason why the script cannot be executed.

Could you send me a Screenshot of your Tables? 

When the Version 3.4.1 is correctly installed the tables are existing.

"	"07/Dec/16 9:15 AM;cst;Thanks, ok the tables were created.

Which database do you use for iteraplan?

Greetings,

Christoph Stangl - iteraplan Support "	07/Dec/16 11:38 AM;admin@mcongroup.net;What do you mean which database?	07/Dec/16 11:38 AM;admin@mcongroup.net;we use mysql 	"07/Dec/16 12:44 PM;cst;This Problem has nothing to do with the scripts or iteraplan.
Check your mysql server and fix the reason for the  ERROR 1146 (42S02)""

My recommendation is:

#  Export the database to file
#  verify if exported file is really ok
#  rename the database where I have issues
#  create a new database with the same name that the last
# import the file to the database
# Execute the script again
"	"13/Dec/16 4:32 AM;admin@mcongroup.net;Christoph, thanks for your support.

We've solved the problem modifying the configuration of mysql.
