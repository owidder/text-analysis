TBD: Full text search for dates show wrong results	"*Problem:*

Hibernate Search stores date fields in GMT time.

In this case date ""01/01/2017 00:00:00"" in Munich time (+1 UTC) is stored as ""20161231230000"".

So, when user searches for ""2017"", he gets empty search results.



*Solution:*

Implements custom bridge class for searching date fields.



Implement custom bridge to convert date <==> string that handles timezone differences.
