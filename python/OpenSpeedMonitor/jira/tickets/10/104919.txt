Optimistic Locking Failure when 2 associations are deleted at the same time	"*Reproduce:*



# Go to list view e.g. for InformationSystems, add association column (e.g. ""Relations to Business Objects)

# Double-click in one of the cells of the association column with at least 2 entries

# Delete two entries at once and apply changes



*Expected:*

Both relations are deleted



*Actual:*

One relation cannot be deleted because of the following exception on the server:

{code}

org.springframework.orm.hibernate5.HibernateOptimisticLockingFailureException: Batch update returned unexpected row count from update [0]; actual row count: 0; expected: 1; nested exception is org.hibernate.StaleStateException: Batch update returned unexpected row count from update [0]; actual row count: 0; expected: 1
