* Change the caption of the buttons at the bottom right: *DONE*

""Cancel"", ""Ok"", ""Apply"" - ""Abbrechen"", ""Ok"", ""Anwenden""

* _For the three input fields: attribute (first input field), operator (second input field) and relation (input field below the attributes): Make obvious, that they are (searchable) drop down input fields.
