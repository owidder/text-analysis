Migration-Tool - no relation Information System to Infrastructure Elements	"After the history migration the entry for the relation from Information System to the ""Infrastructure Elements"" are missing.

In this Ticket I atteched both Databases 5.3 / 5.4 + Screenshots.



# Open the ""Interactive Client"" 

# Click on the Information Systems 

# Open the ""Single Element""-View of ""MYSQL""

# Go into the tab ""History"" 

# No entry for the ""Infrastructure Elements"" in the history 



History Version 5.3
