Legend container in Navigator occasionally has wrong size and timestamp is cut.	"Steps to reproduce:

1. Go to list of interfaces.

2. Open Navigator for [CRM # 3.1,Electronic banking # 2.3,262]

{{http://localhost:8080/iteraplan/client/#/nvd?rootId=262}}



When working on this task try to reduce the number of times when {{drawLegend()}} is called. I've put the log message into the NvdLegendMain and see that when page is loaded the {{drawLegend()}} is called 4 times."
