IFD: Edge Filter by Interfaces not InformationFlows	"*Summary:*

The Edge Filter should be based on Interfaces and not on Information Flows."		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	13/Dec/16 11:09 AM	29/Dec/16 2:37 PM														"29/Dec/16 12:25 PM;fka;Needs to be more clarified: Interface filtering vs. edges vs. Infoflow filtering vs ... ?

"	"29/Dec/16 2:37 PM;fka;Stays as it is:

In the New Client the IFD shows InfoFlows as edges, directions of more than one Info Flow of an interface are combined. Primary filtering is on edges, therefore on info Flows.



Edge filtering in the classic client is somewhat indirect: On interfaces, which are only shown if Business Objects are not selected to be shown. Migration will be as follows: Classic Client filters on interfaces are migrated to info flow filters with interface filter extension in the new client."
