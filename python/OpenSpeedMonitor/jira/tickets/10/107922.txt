Performance improvement when opening filter dialog	"With large data (3000+ building blocks), opening a filter dialog can take a few seconds.

Improve this as follows:

Remove number in the header of the manual-selection tab.

Priority 1:

* When opening the filter dialog, do not render the second tab for manual selection

* Only when switching to the second tab, render it according to the then selected filters.



Priority 2:

* When switching to the manual selection tab, show a ""loading indicator"" until the manual selection list is completely rendered.

* Use a similar loading indicatorlike in the diagrams, e.g. with another material component.
