Problem starting iteraplan 5.4	"In our test-environment we tried to start iteraplan after deploying it on the tomcat-server. But it could not be started and the iteraplan.log showed errors: 

[ERROR] [web.context.ContextLoader] Context initialization failed

2016-11-03 11:04:23 

[FATAL] [iteraplan.presentation.ContextListener] Spring Application Context not available. Without that infrastructure, iteraplan does not work! Check your configuration for syntax errors.



i have attached the above mentioned logfile.

Here are some details regarding the execution environment:

[^iteraplan.log-stacktrace.txt] _(12 kB)_"	"03/Nov/16 11:49 AM;cst;Dear Mrs. and Mr.,

thank you for your inquiry. 

We need following files/logs to check the problem:

From the conf-directory of your Tomcat-Installation:
•	server.xml
•	web.xml

The “catalina.out” and “localhost.log” files from your tomcat installation (just for the period, when the error occurred).
From [Tomcat]/webapps/[iteraplan directory]/WEB-INF
•	All files starting with “applicationContext”

From [Tomcat]/webapps/[iteraplan directory]/WEB-INF/classes:
•	log4j.properties

From [Tomcat]/webapps/[iteraplan directory]/META-INF:
•	context.xml (This file can contain passwords -> please remove the passwords)

The iteraplan log files from the period, when the error occurred. The files are called “iteraplan-[version].log” (for today) or „iteraplan-[version].log.[TIMESTAMP]” (for past days). The location of these file was specified during installation and is documented in the file “log4j.properties”.

Greetings,

thank you for your reply. 

Do you maintain another instance of an application on your tomcat server? 
The problem is, that the tomcat is loading a seperate XML-Event-Factory and iterplan trys to use this factory.
We checked it and iteraplan cannot work with ""com.ctc.wstx.stax.WstxEventFactory"".

Would you please check where the "" javax.xml.stream.XMLEventFactory"" is set on your tomcat server,
or set up a fresh tomcat server for the iteraplan instance.

Greetings,

Christoph Stangl - iteraplan Support "	"07/Nov/16 11:12 AM;ip.manuel.straesser;Dear Mr. Stangl,

thank you for your solution. We disables the WstxEventFactory setting and were able to start iteraplan 5.4 successfully.
During startup we are getting the following warnings:

Can we ignore this warnings?

but we working on a solutions for future Versions, that this ""Warning"" dissapears.
