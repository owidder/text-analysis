Create sceleton implementation of the Treemap diagram	"One Building Block Type

One numeric attribute

Number of Boxes = Number of Building Blocks with defined value

Boxes with undefined values are not shown

Negative values are allowed. The most negative value should be the minimum sized box

No hierarchy - just flat: all Building Blocks in scope

Labels show the name of the Building Block and the attribute value, e.g. ""Account Systems - 200""

Coloring by numeric, multi-value enumeration and multi-value responsibility attributes independently of the box-sizing

Borderline for each box (or padding?) to be able to distinguish two adjacent boxes with the same colors

Optional: Option ""Hierachical name as content element's name.""
