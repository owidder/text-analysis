Create Single-Attribute-REST-API (Server)	"*Summary:*

 Create Single-Attribute-REST-API on the Server for all attributes except for hard-coded attributes, date intervals and responsibility attributes = all attributes in scope of ""/api/attributes/""



*Details:*

 * Use""/api/attributes/ID""

 * Use the Single Element REST API ( [https://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan55/Single+Element+API] ) as blueprint for the http status codes and handling of REST commands

 * JSON-structure is defined by /api/attributes/

 * Include permission handling which is defined by permissions on attribute groups

 * New behaviour (-different- same than in the actual classic client UI): *the fix -IPTT-230- was done in the ComponentModel and not in the service* - ensure that the REST-API has the same behaviour

 ** For the field ""Activated for the following Building Block Types"": When one Building Block Type or Relation is removed, also remove all attribute values of this attribute for this Building Block Type in the database



{color:#FF0000}UPDATE: {color} For unassigned values we use """"



{color:#FF0000}UPDATE: {color} Nullable fields are

 * ""description""

 * ""activatedBBTRelations""

 * ""literals""

 * ""lowerBound""

 * ""upperBound""

 * ""unit""



{color:#FF0000}UPDATE:{color}

 *Use Case 1: Client wants to change the name:*

 * Client sends a PUT to the attributes/ID with



{code:java}

{

    ""name"": {

      ""de"": STRING (or ""en"":STRING)

     }

  }

{code}

 * Server returns 200

{code:java}

{

    ""success"": true/false,

    ""errorCode"": X,

    ""errorMessages"": [

        ""message1"",

        ""message2""

    ]

}

{code}



 * The corresponding database-field of name is updated (localisation is ignored)

 * The elasticModel and the classic model is being updated



*Use Case 2: Update of persistentName:*

 * The client is not allowed to send POST or PUT to the field persistentName



*Use Case 3: Update of both localised name at the same time:*

 * The client is not allowed to send POST or PUT to both localised name at the same time



{color:#FF0000}UPDATE: {color}

""id"" field was added to literals of enumeration and responsibility attributes, so PUT requests should include it in JSON body for existing literals.



{color:#FF0000}UPDATE: {color}

""id"" field was added to range values of numeric attributes, so PUT requests should include it in JSON body for existing range values.



{color:red}UPDATE: {color}

New requirement: On successfull PUT or PUST please return a new field ""resource"" in the JSON which returns the full created or edited object



{color:red}UPDATE: {color}

PUT, POST, DELETE should only be accessible if the user has the permission to edit attributes."
