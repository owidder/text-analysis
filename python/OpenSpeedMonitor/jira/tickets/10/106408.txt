Create new attribute and redirect to Single Attribute View (Client)	"*Summary:*

Create the possibility to create a new attribute



*User Story:*

* On the attribute list page create a new button ""Create Element"" (like on the Building Block List)

* After clicking on this button a dropdown is opened and the user selects the attribute type

* After selecting the type the user gets redirected to the Single Attribute View of type with a fake-id

* The Name-field is already selected, so the user can start typing

* The Name-field is the only mandatory field which needs to be entered

* The rest of the fields can be edited by using the ""normal"" edit-features

* All changes are collected and after any route-change the REST-API is called with all changes

* Then trigger reload-service automatically (IPTS-447)

* {color:red}UPDATE: {color} Implement ""Cancel""-Button instead of ""Delete""-Button during creation-process



*Special Case: Date Intervals*

* For this type all three field (start date attribute, end date attribute and color) are mandatory

* Ensure all three fields are filled before allowing any route change

* Everything else is the same as above 





* {color:red}UPDATE:{color} If no name is enter, please display ""EDIT_SERVICE_ERROR_MESSAGES.-10""
