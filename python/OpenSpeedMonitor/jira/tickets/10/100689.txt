*Expected:*

* No exception"		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	26/Oct/16 4:30 PM	27/Oct/16 1:54 PM														"27/Oct/16 11:24 AM;madu;I couldn't reproduce the issue under three major browsers:

Firefox 49.0.2

IE Edge (in IE10 emulation mode)

Google Chrome Canary 56.0.2901.0



Trying to catch the error I've added additional columns in different combinations for all three available levels & still didn't catch the error mentioned in the ticket's description."	"27/Oct/16 12:12 PM;madu;It's reproducable only when you try to resize the *last* column dragging its' right edge.

Initially I've been doing resizing of the columns by dragging theirs' corresponding resize markers at the top left corner."	"27/Oct/16 1:17 PM;madu;#4881



The only 2 places where initResizer() function is used are in app/js/mpd/mpdContent/mpdDiagramBuilder.js lines 191, 192 - like this:

        initResizer(""resizerRight"", resizeRight, resizerHeight, scrollbarSizes, this.configuration.saveDiagramSizesRatio);

        initResizer(""resizerMiddle"", resizeMiddle, resizerHeight, scrollbarSizes, this.configuration.saveDiagramSizesRatio);



In both cases the callback function (last parameter of initResizer) is configuration.saveDiagramSizesRatio() function which excepts only 2 arguments while we were passing 3. So the third one (withoutTimer) which caused an error in console was removed."
