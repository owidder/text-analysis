Fix Elastic Releasebuild job	"[~fka] decided: Move elastic sources to main project. That way no extra release is needed anymore, and we don't need elasticMI as separate project since it is only used by the iteraplan server part.



--- original description ---

For release 5.4, the elastic release jenkins job failed while deploying the build jars to nexus:

http://iteraplan.iteratec.de/jenkins/job/Elastic%20-%20Releasebuild/16/



So we decided to deploy the release tag 4_13_0 manually, which worked fine. Please inverstigate why the jenkins job failed and fix it so it is usable for the next release again.



It might be connected to the fact that we don't use the standard snv repository structure for elastic:

* The trunk is in: iteraplan/branches/elastic-4.1-light

* while the tags are in: iteraplan/tags/elastic_mi_4_13_0



This might lead to problems with the structure of the svn paths given in the pom.xml around line 86."		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	26/Oct/16 2:41 PM	03/Mar/17 3:31 PM
