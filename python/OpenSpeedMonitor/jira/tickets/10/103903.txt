Change layout of CCD-Legend	"*Summary:*

Change the layout of the Cluster Diagram Legend, i.e.



* Increase font size of ""Header"" and ""Rows"" a lot

* Place the ""Header"" and ""Rows"" more left, i.e. reduce their indention

* Replace the default coloring of the header-Building Block Type in the legend with grey, e.g. the Information System Box is not colored red anymore but grey

* Increase font size and height of Building Block Type and Attribute Name Boxes

* Add additional indention for Filters and Coloring

* Increase space between Coloring and next row

1) Should we standardize font styles and indentions for all diagrams with some standard legend (e.g. use font style and indentions for equivalent elements from MPD legend)"	06/Dec/16 1:14 PM;msr;Good idea, if it is possible to reuse standard styles from MPD legend.
