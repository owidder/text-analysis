Information System relations of Information Flow are not mandatory	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_

# Download Excel data from Export/Import page in iteraplan

# Add a new Interface row

# Add new Information Flow row referencing the new Interface, but don't fill in the Information System cells

# Import the Excel file



_Expected:_ In step 4 of the import at the latest, an error should be shown because of the missing Information System references.

_Actual:_ Import goes without error past step 4 and then fails in step 5.



It is also possible to attempt the removal of Information Systems from an existing Information Flow. On Import with conservative strategy, in step 4 changes are displayed, while step 5 runs without error and no changes. This kind of change should not be possible.



For some reason, the information system RelationshipEnds from InformationFlow are not mandatory, but they should be."
