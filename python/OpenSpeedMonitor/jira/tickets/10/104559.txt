If user definded ranges for an attribute are defined, coloring as described aboved should be available. The classic coloring with two min max color values and a gradient in betwenn should also be selectable.

* Coloring entry in the tool area has both options for coloring(it is confusing which one is *{color:blue} user defined ranges {color}* and which one is *{color:blue} min-max {color}*) - *{color:red}See Screenshot 1{color}*

* When choosing user defined coloring, legend is not properly and unit is mussing (ths. Euro, percent etc) - *{color:red}See Screenshot 2{color}*

* User defined coloring in not available in some diagrams -*{color:red}See Screenshot 3{color}*"	"10/Jan/17 11:54 AM;mada;@mash all items that you mention will implemented in scope IPTS-399
