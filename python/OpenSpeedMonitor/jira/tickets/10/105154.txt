Fix sorting by Costs	"Go to the Information System List

Add the costs column if it is not there

Click on the header to sort 



Expected Behaviour: The list is sorted according to the Costs



Actual Behaviour: The list is not sorted at all, the order does not matter"		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	09/Dec/16 4:30 PM	26/Jan/17 9:27 AM
