Unfortunately, I have not found a xwiki-parser which could be included into iteraplan. Being a bit limited, creole is the nearest syntax of all listed here: http://lod.springer.com/wiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiSyntax?syntax=2.0. Nevertheless, it is almost the same syntax as xwiki for the given possibillites.
