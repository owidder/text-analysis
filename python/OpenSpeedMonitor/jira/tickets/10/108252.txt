Filter: Activate ""is"" & ""is_not"" -operator for multi-value attributes and modify ""contains""-operator for multi-value attributes



*Details:*

* Change implementation of IPTQ-176

* ""is"", ""Is_not"", ""contains"" for multi-value attributes should work as in the classic client, i.e.

** ""is""-operator: if at least one value (of multiple values) exacetly matches, the item is in the result set

** ""is_not""-operator: if at least one value (of multiple values) exacetly matches, the item is not in the result set

** ""contains""-operator: if at least one value (of multiple values) partly matches (search-string is a substring), the item is in the result set
