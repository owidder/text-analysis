Creating Interfaces with Transport over REST or Plugin or Import causes fake dummies	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_

# Download Excel data from Export/Import page in iteraplan

# Edit Excel and add a new Interface with transported Business Object:

## Add new line in Interface sheet with a name ""New Interface"" and an arbitrary direction

## Add new line in Information Flow sheet referencing ""New Interface"" and selecting two arbitrary Information Systems and an arbitrary Business Object

# Import the Excel file

# Download Excel data again



_Expected:_ A new Interface with one Information Flow connecting the above selected Information Systems and transporting the selected Business Object



_Actual:_ Two Information Flows attached to the newly created Interface, one of them a dummy flow (with negative ID and no Business Object).



The issue seems to be with the continuous elastic update, as the database does not contain a ""dummy"" transport, and on reloading the elastic model, everything seems to be fine again."
