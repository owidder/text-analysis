Edit-Button in right-aligned columns	"*Problem:* When a right-aligned cell (i.e number or date column) is hovered, the edit button moves the cell content to the left when it appears.



*Expected behaviour:* The cell content stays where it is and the edit button is overlaid (as for left-aligned columns)
