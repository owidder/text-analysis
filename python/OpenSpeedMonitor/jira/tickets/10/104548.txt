Filter Extension: Date-Filter without lower or upper limit



*Details:*

* It should be possible to set a Date-Filter with operator ""between"" without a lower or an upper limit, i.e.

* If the input field is empty, this means no limit (upper or lower)

* Legend:

** No lower limit means: Removing the word ""from""

** No upper limit means: Removing the word ""to""

* Default filter values: both empty fields = no lower or upper limit

* Include functionality to clear an input box, use this icon: https://material.io/icons/#ic_clear

* Don't change the existing UI except for clear-button
