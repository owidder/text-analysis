Micro Edit sends strange response for invalid Business Mappings	"* Create an incorrect BM via REST or the new client (incorrect is for example only a Information System or no Information System).



Expected: an Error-Message saying the BM could not be created

Real: The error message is ""An ID equal to null is not allowed for deletion.""



* Delete relations so that the BM becomes invalid (No ISR or only an ISR)



Expected: an Errormessage the relation could not be changed and no changes

Real: The server reponds with 200 and the BM is completely deleted
