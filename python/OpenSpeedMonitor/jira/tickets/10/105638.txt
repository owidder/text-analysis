BCD: Mulit-value coloring with diagonal stripes and correct sums	"*Summary:*

Add mulitvalue-coloring with diagonal stripes to the Bar Chart Diagram. And correct the sums and all labels, so Business Objects are only counted once (even with multi-value coloring).



*Details:*

1. Add mulitvalue-coloring with diagonal stripes (add it to the common coloring class) for multi-value coloring attributes:



{noformat}

But I suggest using a Linear Gradient Brush:

{noformat}

{code}



    var BRUSH =

      $(go.Brush, go.Brush.Linear,

        { 0.0: ""green"", 0.333: ""green"", 0.334: ""yellow"", 0.666: ""yellow"", 0.667: ""red"", 1.0: ""red"" },

        { start: go.Spot.TopLeft, end: go.Spot.BottomRight });

{code}

{noformat}

For example, using this in the Basic sample as the Node templateâ€™s Shape.fill (and removing the Binding for the Shape.fill) results in:

{noformat}



2. If multi-value coloring is active, still count every Business Object only once for the sums and every label.

One example:

- Type: Information System

- Attribute: Complexity

- Coloring: Accountability



=> expected result: for high still 15, but also the bar ends at 15 and not at 17



{color:red}UPDATE:{color} I'd suggest to order different multivalue segments within a bar by number of multiple values descending.

E.g: Segment with 3 multiple value BOs, segment with 2 multiple value BOs then the segment with single value BOs.

2nd order criterion: single-value segments should still be ordered by literals as usual



{color:red}UPDAT: {color} add some background to the text number and make number of the opposite color

If you agree with this, please, update the description."	10/Jan/17 1:29 PM;dmkh;[~mash], please ensure that text color of segment labels is always correct for different sets of colors within a muti-value segment (see "label text color" screenshot).

Please add improvements mentioned above."	"10/Jan/17 5:48 PM;mash;[~msr], It was found that finding contrast color for  even color numbers in multi valued segments(if they have both dark and bright pallets applied), isn't readable for user. (See screenshot). 

We need to find a way how to represent text color in this case.



What I suggest is to add some background to the text number and make number of the opposite color (See screenshot)"	11/Jan/17 12:21 PM;dmkh;Review is done, please check 2 comments: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-287.
