Create a 4th tab on the homescreen for search	"*Summary:*

Create a 4th tab for ""search"" on *1st position* (from the left)



*Details:*

* On Default this tab is active

* Initially no table is shown, only text input field

* After entering characters with a delay of 3 seconds the search-query is performed, start counting the 3 seconds as soon as the user has stopped typing. If user presses Enter, then do search immediately, don't wait 3 seconds.

* After getting the result a table (-common list-component-) is shown



*UI input field:*

* Tab is called ""Search"" (German: ""Suche"")

* Center shows Text input field with placeholder ""Search"" (German: ""Suche"")

* Left of text input field is the search-icon (like in the Building Block-List)

* Right of text input field is the clear-icon (like in the Building Block-List)

* On hover (mouseover) the description of the search (see classic client for localised descriptions) is shown



*UI result table:*

* Headline: Results: X elements (German: ""Ergebnisse: X Elemente"")

* Three columns ""Name"", ""Description"", ""Found in""

* Names are links to Single Element Views of Building Blocks -or Attributes-

* First show all groups of Building Block Types alphabetically -, last show the group of the attributes-

* Within one group, order the elements by name alphabetically

* No expanding or collapsing of groups



* If the search returns 0 elements, display a message instead of a table.



Search permissions handling is in scope of the task IPTS-345
