Analyse loading time of filter	"*Summary:*

Analyse loading time of filter



*As-Is:*

For customer data with many Building Blocks (a few thousand elements) the initial loading of the filter dialog (time between clicking on the toolarea and filter dialog is open) takes some time (more than 5 seconds).



*Task:*

Analyse this time and find a solution to optimise it.

The filter dialog should only need the small metamodel and not any data from the big datamodel."		Task	iteraplan PO	08/Dec/16 9:56 AM	13/Jan/17 4:44 PM														13/Jan/17 4:44 PM;msr;duplicate to IPTS-487
