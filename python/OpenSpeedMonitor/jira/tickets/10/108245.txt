Problem with Excel Export in the List View 	"Reproduce (with sample data):



# Open the List View of the ""Information Systems""

# Open the ""Description"" on the first Information System

# Enter a "";"" into the ""Description"" and a little bit of text

# After the Export in Excel a additional tab was created



Expected: The "";"" is not a sepperator for a additional tab

Actual: A additional tab is created"		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	12/Jan/17 4:25 PM	24/Jan/17 11:56 AM														"24/Jan/17 10:34 AM;roia;[~mash], with the change you've made, the CSV exports seems to be not working well. To reproduce, perform the same steps as in task description, but export to CSV.

Maybe, having separate separator constants for CSV and XLS is the solution."
