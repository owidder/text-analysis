Correct the grid-width	"After the update of ag-grid header line of the head is correctly aligned, but scrollbars are not considered when calculating the width (only when callling ""reset view"" it works).

In the other cases there is always a scrollbar on the botton, even if the expected width is smaller than the width of the grid"		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	11/Jan/17 3:50 PM	30/Jan/17 1:13 PM
