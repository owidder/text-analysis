Invalid or missing license	"Hi,



We have got the licence number for our installation about one month ago and uploaded it in the production environment via the interface.



We now try to use our test environment after a few months and we get the following message : ""Invalid or missing license"", so we cant' log in.



Could you please tel us how to fix this ?



Best regards.

P.S. It's not too late : Happy New Year !

;-)

same to you, too. 

Here your current license key:

Use the separate license key upload page of iteraplan. If you try to login to an iteraplan installation lacking a valid license, the page is linkend from the login screen error message. The address is: http://[HOST]/[iteraplanContext]/licensing/update.do 

Greetings,
