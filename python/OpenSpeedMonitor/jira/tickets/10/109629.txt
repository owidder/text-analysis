# Open Iteraplan

# Change a date from a Information System to ""31.12.1014""

# Create a excel export and search for this date

# The date changed to ""-1"" 

# A error appears when the excel file will be imported back into iteraplan 



Expected: That a hint or warning appears on ""Export"" and ""Import"" for not valid dates

Actual: Export changes the dates and the import stops "		Improvement	iteraplan PO	25/Jan/17 11:07 AM															02/Mar/17 5:19 PM;fka;Low prio
