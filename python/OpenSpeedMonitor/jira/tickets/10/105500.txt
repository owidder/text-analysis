Upgrade package to 5.4 for Zeiss	"Hello,

 

Mr. Wortmann and  Bernd Albersmann decided that it is the right time now to migrate the iteraplan QA instance from current version 5.1 to the newest version available, 5.4

 

In order to do that, we will have to migrate the database step by step from 5.1 to 5.2 to 5.3 to 5.4.



Could you please sends us the property packages for the upgrade.



Be sure to use the iteraplan-5.4.0-zeiss-premium-installer.zip (i.e. the customized Zeiss installer of iteraplan and not the general not-customized file iteraplan-5.4.0-premium-installer.zip).



Thanks in advance"		Technical question	iteraplan Support	13/Dec/16 4:30 AM	01/Jan/17 7:00 AM														"13/Dec/16 9:02 AM;msr;Hello.
