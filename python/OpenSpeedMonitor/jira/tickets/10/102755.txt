Spring security configuration + exception handling	"*Summary:*

Adapt Spring Security Configuration to use new login-page and route.

Adapt exception handling.



*Details:*

* Adapt {noformat} applicationContext-Spring-Security.xml {noformat} to use new login-page and route

* Also adapt login-page to show correct localisation-keys for different server-exceptions (by url-configuration)

* Take care, some exceptions are thrown with different mechanisms like UserContextInitialisationServiceImpl.java contains some of this errors (reproducable with missing license)

* For incorrect license-message include a link to enter this license (ticket: IPTS-343)"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	16/Nov/16 4:34 PM	19/Dec/16 7:14 PM														15/Dec/16 3:07 PM;mada;Important note: security for customizing resources	"19/Dec/16 7:14 PM;ants;Review done with comments:
