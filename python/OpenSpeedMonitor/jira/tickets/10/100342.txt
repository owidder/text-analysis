Saved Queries List: "building block type" for CCDs with attribute headers	"_Example:_

# Go to CCD in interactive client

# Configure an attribute for the header

# Save as

# Go to all saved queries list



The query saved above does not have a building block type as main content, instead an attribute is the main content. The saved queries list currently does not support this and just shows a dash as ""building block type"" of such a saved CCD configuration.



As iteraplan user I'd like to see which attribute the saved CCD has as main type, or at least a clearer indication that an attribute is the main type.



Difficulty with the first option (displaying the concrete attribute):

Localization keys for attribute names are tied to a building block type. To display the configured attribute, one would have to search through the metamodel for a type that carries the attribute, to then build the localization key from both. This seems rather inelegant and potentially interferes with a graceful handling of building block types not visible due to missing permissions."

* The was SavedQueries list code was refactored in ITERAPLAN-4960, and the modifications done in this ticket here can now be found in sqListView-controller.js (from line 53 onwards)

* Is it really a good idea to show e.g. ""Complexity"" as building block type in the list of saved queries for the case described above? I guess this is also relevant for some other diagrams."	03/Nov/16 4:46 PM;mse;Review ok.
