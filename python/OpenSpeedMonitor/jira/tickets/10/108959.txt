* Operators: is, is_not, arbitrary value
* Values in the UI are ""Yes"" (German: ""Ja""), ""No"" (German: ""Nein"")
* Values in the config/url are true/false
* Ensure the legend is working correctly
* ensure migrated boolean filter is wokring correctly"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	20/Jan/17 4:29 PM	03/Feb/17 3:32 PM														"26/Jan/17 6:53 PM;pma;* go to technical components

* filter available for interfaces yes/no

* refresh  



CURRENTLY: No matches found

EXPECTED: matches found



* also, after closing the filter, the filter opens without a value, even when entered one before

* hardcoded ""yes"" and ""true"" in SingleBooleanFilter.js

* hardcoded entries in filterdialogdataprovider.js (getDialogEntriesForBooleanAttribute)

* please test"	"31/Jan/17 1:25 PM;roia;When list is filtered and language is changed, the result set is re-filtered incorrectly.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Filter list using boolean filter

2. Change the language



Result - items are not filtered properly, when you edit the filter the value in the value input is blank (should be Yes/No)
