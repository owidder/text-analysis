PDF Export of Installation Guide is formatted in strange ways	"See attached PDF, Section Upgrade Guide, page 43.

For example:

* The fourth item on the list of instructions for running the history migration tool is written in a disproportionally large font

* In the first paragraph of page 43 and item 3.a of the instructions for running the history migration tool words are split in weird places. ({{r-unning}} and {{iteraplan-db.pr-operties}})"		Task	iteraplan PO	26/Oct/16 3:30 PM	21/Nov/16 8:59 AM														"14/Nov/16 3:03 PM;fka;AFAIK, the hyphenation problem can't be solved easily. Therefore it stays like it is.



Regarding the font: The effect is well known and caused by copying text from other sources to Confluence. Even if the text is shown as other text in Confluence (in the Edit or even in the View mode), some formatting might persist and then come to effect again in a PDF.

The phenomenon can be avoided by only coping text without any font, size or formatting information, e.g. by using notepad or similiar in between. Alternatively the option ""clear formatting"" in confluence always helps.



Nothing more to do with this ticket."
