Extend attribute-filter with "hardcoded" system-attributes like lastModificationTime	"*Summary:*

Extend attribute-filter with ""hardcoded"" system-attributes like lastModificationTime, lastModificationUser, id



*As-Is:*

* Filter for attribute values (e.g. in the Cluster Diagram) only work for ""dynamic"" attributes which come from the REST-API ""/api/attributes""



*To-Be:*

* Extend the filter for attributes to also work with ""hardcoded"" system-attributes like lastModificationTime, lastModificationUser, id

* Potential problem: At the moment these ""hardcoded"" system-attributes do not have any localisation, which causes problems in the manual selection filter"		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	30/Nov/16 4:44 PM	23/Feb/17 10:36 AM														23/Feb/17 9:54 AM;dmkh;review is done, only one comment: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-385#general-comments
