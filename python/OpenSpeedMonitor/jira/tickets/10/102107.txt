REST-API of history in "wrong" order	"*Summary:*

The changesets in the REST-API of the history are in a different order than the changesets in the database, if the Plugin-API does a change.



*Reproduce:*

* Create a script, which changes costs for projects to 80

* Load this script

* Change the costs to 100



*Actual:*

* In the JSON of the history-REST-API the change on top states ""changed to 100"" (latest change)



*Expected:*

* In the JSON of the history-REST-API the change on top should state ""changed to 80"" (latest change), as this was done by the Plugin-API and 80 is the actual value"		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	09/Nov/16 8:55 AM	07/Feb/17 11:01 AM														06/Feb/17 3:19 PM;mse;In the REST-API, the order is correct now, but in the GUI, the plugin change is still shown first...
