Edit on Single Element View 	"Add Edit functionality to single Element view for standalone building Block Types



general idea: 

* on mouseover over the attribute value appears edit button. Single click on it starts editing

* double click on attribute value start editing.



use existing components for editing. (with popup edit field and ""Confirm"" and ""Cancel"" buttons)
