Show all attributes of relations next to the relation itself	Show all attributes of relations next to the relation itself, e.g. "Apportionment" on the relation between Information System to Infrastructure Elements		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	07/Nov/16 2:57 PM	03/Jan/17 9:17 AM														"24/Nov/16 1:27 PM;roia;[~viol], [~msr], is this task about all attributable relations or just about Apportionment attribute of Information System -> Infrastructure Element relation?

Or the implementation of the other attributable relations, like CRUD attribute of Information System -> Business Object relation is also in scope of this task?



[~msr], is it possible to set up/determine the attributes of the relations dynamically or they can be hardcoded?

"	"24/Nov/16 1:37 PM;msr;Yes, this task is about *all* attributes (dynamic) on all relations which can have attributes (static list).

Please have a look at the attached metamodel and all *4* relations with a star can have attributes.



!metamodel.png!"	05/Dec/16 3:42 PM;viol;Please add revision #5358 to review	"06/Dec/16 8:17 AM;roia;Note for the future (not related to this task, but to your code from previous tasks):

Instead of using {{every()}} to find some item in array please use the helper function {{findObjectInArray()}} from {{utils.js}}

E.g., this code

{code}

                                        relObjects.every(function (item) {

                                            if (item.id === obj.id) {

                                                item.direction = relObjDirection.getPropertyValues(""direction"")

                                            }



                                            return !(item.id === obj.id);

                                        });

{code}

could be rewritten like:

{code}

    var item = findObjectInArray(relObjects, ""id"", obj.id);

    if( item ) {

        item.direction = relObjDirection.getPropertyValues(""direction"");

    }

{code}

This produces less lines of code and is easier for reading and understanding."	12/Dec/16 11:48 AM;dmkh;Check attributes of Infrastructure element relation of Information system (disappear after refresh)
