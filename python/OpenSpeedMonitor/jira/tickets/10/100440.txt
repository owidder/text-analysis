Manual selection filter is not saved in queries	"Reproduce:



# Open Information System list view in interactive client

# Add a ""Manual selection"" filter and an additional column (e.g. Costs)

# Click on ""Save as"" and save list view as private query

# Got ot ""Visualize+Report"" tab and open ""All saved queries"" list

# Click on the query saved before



Expected:

* The list view as saved is loaded (with additional column and with manual selection)



Result:

* The list is opened, but the manual selection is ignored.

* The query is not recoginized, so no ""Save"" button and no query name next to the iteraplan logo"		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/Oct/16 1:11 PM	26/Oct/16 11:20 AM														"26/Oct/16 9:47 AM;msr;Please check this, too:

Another defect with probably the same root cause appeared:

* Open the Landscape Diagram

* Filter by Complexity = high

* Click on Filter\Manual Selection and select on the first three entries

* Click on ""Apply"" and ""Close""

* Reopen Filter\Manual Selection



Actual: All Checkboxes are active



Expected: Only the first three checkboxes should be active"	26/Oct/16 11:00 AM;madu;#4852 for review in trunk	"26/Oct/16 11:07 AM;madu;Marcel,



I can't reproduce filters issue with LSD under IE edge (in IE10 emulation) and Google Chrome 56.0.2899.0 canary (64-bit) with the current trunk.

Could you please double check?
