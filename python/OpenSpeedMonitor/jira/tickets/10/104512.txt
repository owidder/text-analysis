Information System Flow column can be added twice in list view	"Reproduce:



* Got to IS list view

* Click add column and search for Information Flow



Expected:

* One Information Flow column can be added



Actual:

* There is ""Information Flow"" and ""Information Flow 2"" (see screenshot)



According to [~aan], the ""Information Flow 2"" column should not be visible in the list as it is only used internally to get the connections right."
