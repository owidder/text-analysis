Distrigation: LSD: Implement new functionality of new UI	"*Summary:*

Distrigation: LSD: Implement new functionality of new UI ( IPTS-394 ):



*Details:*

UI-Improvement: Deactivate ""Distribution""-Checkbox, when Level 1 is selected, deactivate ""Aggregation""-Checkbox, when lowest level of hierarchy is selected.



The diagram is immediately redrawn after changing the slider or clicking on a checkbox.



Refactor the levelFilters within the CombinedFilter to support infinite number of levels.



Number of levels for level selection is dynamically calculated:

* Calculate number of levels

* Handover this number as max for the level-slider



Rangeslider-selection is the used for levelfilter in the diagram:

* As-Is: The hardcoded toolarea entries are used for the levelfilter in the LSD

* To-Be: The dynamic rangeslider-values are used for the levelfilter in the LSD



Aggregation & Distribution can be actived and deactivated independantely of the level-filter:

* As-Is: Aggregation & Distribution is automatically active if the level-filter is active

* To-Be: Aggregation & Distribution can be turned on and off independantely additionaly to the level-filter

* It is always aggregated from all levels under to the lower bound of the rangeslider,

** e.g. if the lower bound of the rangeslider is 3 and there exist level 4 and 5, then level 4 and 5 are aggregated to level 3

* It is always distributed from all levels over to the upper bound of the rangeslider,

** e.g. if the upper bound of the rangeslider is 3 and there exist level 1 and 2, then level 1 and 2 are distributed to level 3



{color:red}UPDATE: {color}

*Legend:*



*No aggregation or distribution - just hierarchy level filter:*

""Hierarchy level from X to Y"" / German: ""Hierarchie-Stufen von X bis Y""



*Active Aggregation + Active distribution + hierarchy level filter:*

""Hierarchy level from X to Y"" / German: ""Hierarchie-Stufen von X bis Y""

""Including distribution of relations"" / German: ""Enthält Distributionen von Beziehungen""

""Including aggregation of relations"" / German: ""Enthält Aggregationen von Beziehungen"""		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	02/Dec/16 4:27 PM	19/Jan/17 4:42 PM														"10/Jan/17 2:57 PM;dmkh;Review is done: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-288.
