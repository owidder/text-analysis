Relationship editor is closed when auto-select menu is clicked 	"Reproduce:



* Got to list view

* Start editing a relationship cell

* Click in the editor behind all chips to open the auto-complete menu

* Select a item from the menu



Expected:

* Selected item is added to the chips of relations



Actual:

* The editor is closed, the item is not added



First analysis: It seems that ag-grid interprets the cklick into the auto-complete menu as a click outside the cell editor. This causes the editing to step without an update of the cell content."
