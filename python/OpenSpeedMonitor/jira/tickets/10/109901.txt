No lines in information flow diagram	"When tring to export an information flow diagram with the classic client using Visio, the element boxes are displayed but not the connecting interface lines.  I also tried it with the iteraplan online demo.  See attached image.  



I'm using Visio 2010.  Are there any Visio settings that I should verify?  Do macros need to be enabled? Any suggestion what I should try?



Thank you, hannes callsen

thank you for your inquiry.

Which template were you used for the Visio-Export in our online Demo? 
Then I going to check it with our Visio installation.

It's not just with your demo, I have the same problem with our installation of iteraplan as well.  Am i missing some driver or an update of someting?	"30/Jan/17 11:55 AM;cst;Dear Mr. Callisen,



thank you for your reply. 



I checked the download with our installation of Visio 2016 and the interface lines are shown. 

Could you please test the attached Visio file to check the interface linies.

When with this file the lines are shown, it can be a problem with the macro settings of your Visio 2010. 



On the following link from the Microsoft Webside you can find the steps to activate the macros.

Christoph Stangl - iteraplan Support "	"30/Jan/17 12:18 PM;hannes.callisen@boehringer-ingelheim.com;Thank you for the quick reply.  Since we have Visio 2010, I have to first install a compatability pack to run a Visio 2016 chart.
But, to confirm, are you saying that macros must be enabled in Visio?
In other words, if you disable macros in your Visio, then the interface lines will no longer show.  Right?
"	"30/Jan/17 12:49 PM;cst;Correct, I tested it here with deactivated macros and no lines are shown in the VIsio file.
