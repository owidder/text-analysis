Treemap: zooming	"Use the GoJS zooming feature.

The zoom-level calculation should be implemented like in the Cluster Diagram:

have constants for min, max ans step (let's currently use MIN: 5, MAX: 300, STEP: 5)

and override the scaling calculation

Zoom level should be displayed in the legend if it's not = 100% 

Zoom level should be saved in URL/configuration if it is set by user.
