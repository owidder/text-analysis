Visualisation in Iteraplan	"what Version of java do we need? (see information under)



Dear Mr. Haug,

 

thank you for your inquiry.

 

I checked the ""Error"" and the problem could be appear because of a older JDK Version.

Would you please update JDK on your Linux-Server.

Hi.

 

I got some error issues when using reports for visualisations.

Any idea why?

thank you for your inquiry. 

Would please check which version on server is installed. 
Our recommendation is the most recent version of your JDK Version.

If this does not solve the problem, we are need the current Problem Report and the following log files.

From the conf-directory of your Tomcat-Installation:
•	server.xml
•	web.xml

The “catalina.out” and “localhost.log” files from your tomcat installation (just for the period, when the error occurred).

From [Tomcat]/webapps/[iteraplan directory]/WEB-INF
•	All files starting with “applicationContext”

From [Tomcat]/webapps/[iteraplan directory]/WEB-INF/classes:
•	log4j.properties

From [Tomcat]/webapps/[iteraplan directory]/META-INF:
•	context.xml (This file can contain passwords -> please remove the passwords)

The iteraplan log files from the period, when the error occurred. The files are called “iteraplan-[version].log” (for today) or „iteraplan-[version].log.[TIMESTAMP]” (for past days). The location of these file was specified during installation and is documented in the file “log4j.properties”.
