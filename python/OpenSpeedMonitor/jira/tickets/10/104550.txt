Filter Extension: Operator "not between" for numeric and date attributes	"*Summary:*

Filter Extension: Operator ""not between"" for numeric and date attributes



*Details:*

* Create a new operator ""not between"" (German ""nicht zwischen"")

* Meaning: All other values except for the ones in the intervall, 

** e.g. not between 2-5 means all values strict less than 2 and strict bigger than 5

* Undefined / Null values are always in the result set

*  Include the operator for numeric and date attributes 



*UI:*

* for numeric: Use a range slider to select the values but hightlight the ares outside the selected interval

* for date: Use existing date pickers like between-operator, ensure end date is greater or equal to start date



*Legend:*

Attribute-Name ""not between"" first-value ""and"" second-value
