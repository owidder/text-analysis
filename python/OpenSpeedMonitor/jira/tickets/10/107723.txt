Don't send request to server if value is not changed during edit	At the moment, a request is sent to the server even if the user did not perform any real change but just started editing and closed it again. As I can see, this is done for all column types. I think it should not cause any problems as the server returns a proper response and it also should not cause major performance issues. But maybe we can still do better here without too much effort		Improvement	iteraplan Thunderduck	09/Jan/17 10:42 AM	19/Jan/17 9:53 AM														"16/Jan/17 3:01 PM;mse;Number columns don't work correctly (number format is lost...). Solution:



* Return correctly formatted number string in NumCellEditor.getValue

* Parse string to number in editService.setNumProperty



Advantage:



* formatNumberAfterEdit() in updateBuildingBlock() (in ipList-component.js) is obsolete

* numbers can be compared as strings in areEntriesEqual() as they have been formatted by the same piece of code"
