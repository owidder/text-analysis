Filter Extension: Date-Filter "not between" without lower or upper limit	"*Summary:*

Filter Extension: Date-Filter ""not between"" without lower or upper limit



*Details:*

* It should be possible to set a Date-Filter with operator ""no between"" without a lower or an upper limit, i.e.

* If the input field is empty, this means no limit (upper or lower)

* Legend:

** No lower limit means: Attribute ""greater than"" value (German: ""größer als"")

** {color:red}ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENT for case ""between"" with no lower limit: ""Attribute *up to* 01/01/2017""{color} (German: ""bis zu"")

** No upper limit means: Attribute ""less than"" value (German: ""kleiner als"")

** {color:red}UPDATE:{color} No limits at all means for the legend: ""Attribute *up to* Maximum"" or for not-between ""Attribute *less than* Maximum""

* Default filter values: both empty fields = no lower or upper limit

* Include functionality to clear an input box, use this icon: https://material.io/icons/#ic_clear

* Don't change the existing UI except for clear-button

See the attached !not-between-for-duration.jpg|thumbnail! -- the result set contains rows which are greater than value: years 2016, 2024, etc.
