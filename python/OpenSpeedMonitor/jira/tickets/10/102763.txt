Currently in case of error response (with statuses 4xx, 5xx) we just display the status code and status text.

Also we can display the response body (if don't need localization), or implement some flexible solution -- if body is present, display body, if not - status code and status text."	"30/Nov/16 9:12 AM;msr;Hi [~roia].

Please extend the current solution to display also the response body if available,

i.e. display the status code, status text and response body (if available). No localisation at the moment."	"30/Nov/16 2:03 PM;roia;Implemented in scope of IPTS-334
