Colorpicker supports Hex-code and RGB-code	"*Summary:*

1. Find a new colorpicker library which fullfills the following requirements



* {color:red}UPDATE: {color} Please check, that it works with all supported browser (especially Internet Explorer 10)

* Colorpicker with visual color gradient to pick a color

* should support all our supported browser

* Input field for HEX- and RGB-color-code

* exact positioning left of a GoJS-panel (canvas!) in the legend

* works together with current controller-template architecture, i.e. can be opened by a mouse-event in the legend and returns selected color-value

* preferable without jQuery-Dependency

* license like MIT or Apache2 (check together with [~msr] or [~fka] )



2. Include new colorpicker in our code with the help of bower



3. Include new colorpicker in all diagrams and adapt ColorUtils, if necessary



4. Remove old colorpicker-code
