Cannot delete InformationFlow via Microedit API	"Reproduce:

* Try to delete a InformationFlow via the microedit REST API, e.g.:IPTS-399
{noformat}
DELETE http://localhost:8080/iteraplan/api/element/InformationFlow/707
{noformat}

Expected:
* Information flow is deleted 

Actual:
* 500 (general server error) response because of IteraplanTechnicalException
at de.iteratec.iteraplan.model.TypeOfBuildingBlock.fromInitialCapString(TypeOfBuildingBlock.java:324)

The problem is that there is no InformationFlow in the datamodel of the classical client, instead the according Transport entity must be deleted.
