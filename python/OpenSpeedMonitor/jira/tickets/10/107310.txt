LSD: SVG contains yAxis elements twice	"See the attached SVG.



In the LSD diagram, the SVG export contains all elements on the yAxis (left side) twice. Number 1 as it appears in the application, visible/on top. And number 2 with the text aligned at top, otherwise with same position and size, hidden/behind number 1. 



This confuses a Visio conversion of the diagram.



No obvious reason for this duplication has been found by [~ach] when looking at the code quickly. Currently it's only known to appear on the yAxis of the LSD.



Maybe it's a GoJS Bug. Analyse and fix. Timebox 1 PD."		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	04/Jan/17 3:51 PM	14/Feb/17 12:56 PM
