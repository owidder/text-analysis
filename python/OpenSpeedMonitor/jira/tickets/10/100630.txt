Permission handling for NCD	"Add permission handling for NCD diagram. Check inner, outer types and relations between them if needed. Ensure that permission handling also works with attributes as cluster types (combination of attribute and building block type).



Use MPD or PFD diagrams as blueprint. Show appropriate warning message."		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	26/Oct/16 12:05 PM	02/Nov/16 11:14 AM														"01/Nov/16 5:01 PM;dmkh;Review is done: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-139



There is exception when user downloads diagram without permission for building block type that is used for path between inner and outer elements (also see attachments)



*To reproduce:*

*_User 1:_* Has all permissions, configures NCD diagram (inner clusters: *Business Process*, outer clusters: *Business Object*, path to outer elements: *Business Domain -> Business Object*) and passes URL (or sends saved query) to *_User 2_*



*_User 2:_* Has no permissions for *Business Domain*, opens URL (or saved query) from *_User 1_*"	01/Nov/16 6:40 PM;ants;Fixed in revision 4966.
