Migration for Cluster Diagram			New Feature	iteraplan Thunderduck	08/Dec/16 4:36 PM	02/Feb/17 8:00 AM														"23/Jan/17 11:41 AM;sfe;Attempted to migrate cluster diagrams from demo data:

* Attempt to migrate ""1. Input for technical standardisation"" => NullPointerException in CcdMigration:109

Special case ""attributeId == 0"" has no attributeType object but is handled in the block below

The same seems to happen with ""5. Strategic overview IT Services""

* Attempt to migrate ""4. Oberview of Business Objects"" => NullPointerException in CcdMigration:141

Seems to be the same issue, just with ""attrId == -1""

* Coloring by Accountability is not migrated in the other two diagrams

* Classic option ""Hierachical name as content element's name"" does not seem to be migrated."
