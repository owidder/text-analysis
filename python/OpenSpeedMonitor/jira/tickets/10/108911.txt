thank you for your inquiry.

The iteraplan error log can only be executed by the ""iteraplan_supervisor"". 
When a user has the role ""iteraplan_supervisor"", then the error log´s will be created. 

You can add users into the groups with ""iturm"". When you use LDAP for your user managment, please reply on this ticket.

sorry, I was out of office last week.

The users and groups are managed in a remote ldap server.
Till now, we have only configured 3 groups for the customer who has the problem.

cn=itera_Admin
cn=itera_EA_Technology
cn=itera_Reader

Should we include the user to the ""cn=iteraplan_Supervisor"" group?

Regards Matthias

"	"31/Jan/17 8:42 AM;cst;Good Morning,

thank you for your reply. 

To check the problem, it is enough when one Group has the ""iteraplan_Supervisor"" role.
You can do following steps to connect the roles in the database.

# Open the table ""ROLE"" in the database, here see you all created roles.
# Note the ID from one of the ""cn"" above (e.g. 5) and the id of the iteraplan_Supervisor (e.g. 2)
# Open the table ""ROLE_ROLE"" and link both ID´s together. First comes the id of the ""cn"" and the second ID is the iteraplan_Supervisor
e.g 5 - 2

After that steps, the group has the ""iteraplan_Supervisor"" rights and you can create the error logs.

thank you for your reply.

I checked the log files and your environment is using ""openjdk"". 
We don't support ""openjdk"" with iteraplan, because it can happen that random side effects will be appear.

You find this part in our online ""Prerequisites"" for version 5.2.

"	"06/Feb/17 2:27 PM;matthias.roth@dekra.com;Hello Christoph,

thank you. We will try it with Oracle Java 1.8.0. But I have to wait for a downtime tomorrow morning. I've checked the requirements for Version 5.3. It is the same there. Is there a future plan to Support openjdk too. We would prefer it, because we use the whole RedHat stack.

I will update the ticket tomorrow.

Regards Matthias
