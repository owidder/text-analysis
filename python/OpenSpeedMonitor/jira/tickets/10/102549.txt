History not shown in classic client	After migrating to iteraplan 5.4 we observed that the History-Tab is only shown in the new client. How can we activate the display of the history in the classic client?		Fault	iteraplan Support	14/Nov/16 3:35 PM	03/Dec/16 7:00 AM														"14/Nov/16 4:00 PM;cst;Dear Mr. and Mrs., 



thank your for your inquiry. 



After the History Migration and using the Version 5.4 of iteraplan, the history in the old client is not longer availlible.
