Login: Check special cases of Login	"*Summary:*

After implementing the standard login-functionality

 

* Check, if LDAP-installation still works (to be done by [~msr] or [~cst] )

* Check, if SSO-installation still works (to be done by [~msr] or [~cst] )

* Check, if all custom installer still work (to be done by [~msr] or [~cst] )

* And adapt login-functionality (if necessary)



* Create two templates:

** one standard login-template

** and one custom login-template with demo-user and demo-password on the login-page

* Create an additional grunt-job ""createDemoLoginPage"" with copies and replace the standard template with the custom template

grunt.file.copy(

            './tests/e2etest/local.conf.template.js',
