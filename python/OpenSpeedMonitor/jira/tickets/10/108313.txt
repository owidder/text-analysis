--- Old description ---

Open an editor at the bottom of the list. The editor is not at the correct position but above."		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	13/Jan/17 1:53 PM	26/Jan/17 2:40 PM														"24/Jan/17 2:01 PM;mse;* Bug fix in ag-grid 7.2 alone does not resolve the problem.



Comment from sprint review on 24/01/2017:



* Automatic re-positioning of editor (ag-grid default behaviour) is ok for the time being

* Suppress scrolling when editing is active

* If feasable: highlight cell which is currently edited (or grey out all other rows...)"	"25/Jan/17 10:28 AM;ach;after Review meeting:
