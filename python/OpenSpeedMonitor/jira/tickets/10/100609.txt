Error in responsibility attribute handling in interactive client	"_Reproduce:_

# Create a Text attribute ""Suffix""

# Create an Enum attribute ""Prefix-Suffix""

# Assign both attributes to at least one type (does not have to be the same one)

# Open the interactive client



=> The client doesn't load. browser console shows an error related to ""this.type"" being undefined in SimpleProperty



The Text attribute ""Suffix"" is treated as Responsibility attribute, without the data to back it up.

Expected: Only treat Text attributes as Responsibility attributes in the correct cases (when they're actually derived from a classic Responsibility attribute)"		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Oct/16 10:01 AM	26/Oct/16 11:15 AM
