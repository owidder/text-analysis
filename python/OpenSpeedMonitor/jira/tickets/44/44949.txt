"Transient" relationships between building block types	"I tried to model the answer to a question from the EAM introduction workshop document I, slide #37: ""If there is a bug in Java, what processes and products are affected?""

This answer could not be modeled using diagrams, e.g. the landscape diagram. However, when selecting ""technical components"" as the content, I cannot select processes, products, etc. but just the directly relating building block types. Would it be possible to enable ""transient"" relationships, i.e. processes which have relationships to information systems which have themselves relationships to technical components."
