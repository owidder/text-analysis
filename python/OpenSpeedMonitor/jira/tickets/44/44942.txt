Excel import - "speaking" log messages	"Currently the log messages during Excel import are quite ""technical"". E.g. there are ""DEBUG"" messages presented to the user.

Would propose to show meaningful log messages, without leading DEBUG, INFO etc. but just tell the user what happened. In his language preferably, of course (see ITERAPLAN-42)"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	19/May/11 7:41 AM	27/Jun/12 1:26 PM					excel	import								"31/Jan/12 2:16 PM;tse;Also make sure that the error messages are understandable.
