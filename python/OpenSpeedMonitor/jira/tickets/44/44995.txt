Improve saving of the BusinessMappings	"The associated classes of the BusinessMapping use the GeneralBuildingBlockService to save the BusinessMapping entities. It means, that the BMs are not validated and corrupt data can be imported. For example the ExcelImporter can import inconsistent data, which causes the system crashed trying to open Information system (see ITERAPLAN-39).
I suggest we replace the GeneralBuildingBlockService with the BusinessMappingService and check, if the BMs contains consistent data."
