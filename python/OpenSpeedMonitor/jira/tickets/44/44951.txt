Relationships remain intact during Excel import, even building block name has changed	"If an Id is specified and a building block of that type with that Id can be found, that building block is updated. In case the name of the building block was changed and would result in a duplicate name within the building block name, iteraplan will still import and update the existing building block with the information given. In case the relations in the Excel file were not maintained, iteraplan will apply the previously existing relations, e.g. between business processes and information systems, to the updated entry.

Consequence: the definition of semantics (i.e. defining relationships based on the name of building blocks) is not kept."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	19/May/11 8:16 AM	27/Oct/11 2:50 PM					excel	import								"27/Oct/11 2:50 PM;sry;The issue can no longer be reproduced with iteraplan 2.9.0 and has probably been fixed since 2.8.0 as part of another ticket.
Renamed elements which cause a name collision are properly skipped, including relations and attributes in that row."
