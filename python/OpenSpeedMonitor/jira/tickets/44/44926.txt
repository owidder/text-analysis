Improved support for editing of business mappings	Is it possible to place the '\-' element into the text field on the left-hand side automatically if no other existing element is selected? Otherwise if the user de-selects the only one element by removing it to the right-hand side (and does not select this '\-' element back to the left-hand side), he won't be able to store this business mapping, although the constellation in the UI seems to be correct. The error message in this case "...Please choose at least one entry for each component of the Business Mapping." is a bit irritating too. For ordinary users that would mean they have to complete the mapping with existing elements and I don't think they would take '\-' as an element into consideration.
