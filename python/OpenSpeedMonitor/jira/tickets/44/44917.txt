IndexOutOfBoundsException at iteraplan Dashboard	"When trying to open the iteraplan dashboard while the database doesn't have any entries for, for example, technical component releases, you get an IndexOutOfBoundsException.
The reason in this example is following part of the DashboardController's code which apparently is used to determine the BuildingBlockType:

{code}
[...] elements.getTcrList().get(0).getBuildingBlockType() [...]
{code}

Since the list of technical component releases in our example is empty, the exception occurs."
