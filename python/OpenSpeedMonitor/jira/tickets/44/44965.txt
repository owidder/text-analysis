Proper error handling in reporting when permissions restricted permissions apply 	"Several reproting mechanism fail if a the logged in user does not have access permissions for building blockk types like products, business processes or business units. 

Specifically, missing permission for products means that saved queries involving business mappings cannot be executed any longer. This impacts masterplan graphics, information flow graphics, spredsheet report and others.

Evaluations on business mappings should be possible even if not all components are accessible. Inaccessible components should be greyed out. If a saved query includes inaccessible elements, an instructive error message (business exception!) should be displayed.
Graphics generation should not fail with an internal/technical error just because permissions are missing. Instead, a meaningful error message should appear."
