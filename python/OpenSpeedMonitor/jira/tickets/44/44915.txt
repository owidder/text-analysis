Permission-bug when creating reports without permission to view information systems	"As user without permission to view information systems, you still can query a list of information systems by, for example, going to diagram reports -> cluster diagram and simply clicking ""send query"". The result list is the one returned by the standard query for information systems, because the report memory bean was initialized for information systems.

Original ticket in Trac: https://iteraplan.iteratec.de/projects/iteraplan/ticket/2292"		Bug	iteraplan PO	02/May/11 2:53 PM	27/May/11 10:51 AM					permissions									02/May/11 2:54 PM;sfe;I already found a solution for this issue.	27/May/11 10:40 AM;vsh;If a diagram report is selected from the drop down menu on the initial page but the user doesn't have the necessary permissions, the error page is displayed. Can we provide a more user-friendly output? Maybe we can redirect to the initial page with the error message included so that it can be displayed in the red-bordered error field like in the other reports. Otherwise, the permission check seems to work.	27/May/11 10:51 AM;vsh;Permissions are checked now.
