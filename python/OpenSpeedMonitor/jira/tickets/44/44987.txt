Deletion of Attribute Type Groups can cause database corruption	"example reproducer (with BankData):
1. Create a new Attribute Type Group and assign the Attribute ""Complexity"" to it. Save.
2. Delete the Attribute Type Group.

Now the Default Attribute Type Group cannot be viewed and edited anymore, because the ""Complexity""-Attribute, which was put back into Default Attribute Type Group when we deleted the new ATG before, has an invalid value assign in the ""POS"" column of the ""AT""-table in the database."		Bug	iteraplan PO	08/Jun/11 11:03 AM	14/Jun/11 9:09 AM					AttributeTypeGroup									10/Jun/11 10:09 AM;sfe;The corruption already happens when creating the new Attribute Type Group, apparently.	10/Jun/11 10:54 AM;sfe;Also happens if you assign an Attribute to a different Attribute Type Group, because the "POS"-values of the remaining Attributes aren't adjusted accordingly.
