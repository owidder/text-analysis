Extend the custom column functionality of the Masterplan Diagram (ITERAPLAN-33)	This issue is a continuation of the feature from ITERAPLAN-33. The functionality of the Masterplan Diagram custom columns should be extended as follows: For the Masterplan Diagram custom columns all self-referencing relationships (e.g. Hierarchy), in both their directions, should also be available. For the affected building block types (Information System, Project, Technical Component) the additional custom columns should also be available in the tabular reports.

See screenshot.	14/Jun/11 11:13 AM;bsi;In master plan diagram the {{all}} checkbox is not selected although all search results are selected	"14/Jun/11 6:10 PM;sry;The wide table in spreadsheet reports doesn't exactly look nice, that's true; but I believe it's acceptable and obviously the table has to become wide as you add columns. I doubt that anyone will complain about that. It's good that the query creation form is only as wide as the browser window, and it's ok that you need to scroll in order to see the complete results table.

Re *All* checkbox: This applies to other graphics as well, e.g. info flow diagram. Please create a separate ticket, Blagina.

@kgo: Sorry, I forgot to create the ticket for you. Well done :)"	14/Jun/11 6:11 PM;sry;Checked in a small refactoring, tested rest of the implementation.	14/Jun/11 7:04 PM;sry;Updated the documentation, should be complete now.
