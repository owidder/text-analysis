Offer a query language for more powerful queries	"The query language iteraQl which was proposed in the bachelor's thesis of kgo should be integrated in iteraplan. For this purpose, a new menu item should be added in the 'Reports' category of the iteraplan main menu. The corresponding page should allow the user to initialize the query language, reload the image made from the iteraplan database, and to enter queries in a text field and request their execution. In the case of successful execution of a query, the second component of the query result (see the bachelors thesis of kgo) should be displayed in the page, making use of the templates for tabular reporting. In the query execution was unsuccessful an appropriate error message is to be reported to the user. At this point no on-the-fly synchronization of the query language data image and the iteraplan database is expected.

Note: So far, the integration has been tracked under Ticket #2299"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	28/Apr/11 4:22 PM	30/Jun/11 1:48 PM					iteraQl	query	reports
