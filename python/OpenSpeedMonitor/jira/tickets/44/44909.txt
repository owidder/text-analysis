Accessibility - HTML Table heading row as TH-Element	"In many iteraplan tables, there is a row at the top that isn't really a heading row, but is tagged in html as TH. This causes the screen reader to treat this as the heading row. For example, If I choose the Information Systems building block, a list of information systems is returned as a table. The first row of the table is a single cell (spanning 3 cells) containing the text ""Found Information Systems"". This row is tagged with <th>. The real heading row is Row 2 in the table. This contains the column headings ""Information System"" ""Hierarchical Name"" and "" Description"". This row doesn't have the <th> tag and the screen reader doesn't recognise it as as the heading row.
