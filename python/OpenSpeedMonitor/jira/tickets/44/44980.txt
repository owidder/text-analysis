Excel Import: improve handling of conflicts when importing building blocks with specified ID	"If you re-import an Excel file (where building blocks IDs are set), you receive a lot of warnings that building blocks with that name but different ID would exist already. Core attributes like Name and Description are not update as a consequence. The issue is probably in {code}ExcelImportService#importContentToDaos{code} where this case handled too generally.

In specific configurations (if an element with the same name but a different id exists, or if no element with the specified id exists) the import aborts with an error page instead of ignoring the conflicting rows (with according log entries)."

However: In cases you really try to import elements with names which already exist in the database under a different ID, or elements with a specified ID which doesn't exist in the database, exceptions are thrown earlier in the import process, resulting in error pages. This should be changed and the exceptions properly caught and handled."	"07/Jul/11 2:52 PM;vsh;The following case needs consideration: if you change the name of a technical component/information system in one of several existing releases and then do an import, the changes are discarded. Example: export ISs CRM #3.1 and #3.2, change the name of CRM #3.1 to CTM #3.1 and try to import the data. The changes are not reflected in the database and no warnings are printed. Same behavious is observed for TCs, test with Java #1.4, Java #5.0 and Java #6.0

The ids of the affected TC/IS remain unchanged.

Here special consideration should be paid to the case when the modified IS/TC is part of a self referencing relationship like predecessor <-> successor or ""is used by""."	07/Jul/11 4:13 PM;sfe;Renaming works, but each row of the sheet referencing a release of the same information system or technical component renames this system/this component, so only the last of these rows counts really.	08/Jul/11 4:29 PM;vsh;OK
