Hibernate/EhCache should respect active datasource and not mix up database contents	"The EhCache integration in iteraplan must be modified so that it reliably works together with different datasources.

At the moment, can you run into this scenario: You have two databases with (almost) identical contents and one is iteraplan MASTER datasource, the other is linked up as a secondary datasource. If you change an element with ID X in the MASTER datasource, and then switch to the secondary datasource, the element there with ID X will look like it was changed as well. Moreover, you can have all kinds of strange Hibernate exceptions because objects of an unexpected type can be returned from the cache.

The caching integration should use both object ID and datasource identifier together as the cache key."

We could create our own decorator and replace the given keys with our own. For example we could always prepend the active datasource name.
