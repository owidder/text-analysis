Refactoring: Building Block delete without previous loading	  Refactoring: Building Block should be directly deleted from databank without previous loading of the respective entity.		Improvement	iteraplan PO	06/May/11 10:04 AM	18/May/11 10:10 AM														"16/May/11 8:36 AM;agu;The deleteEntity(id) methods were replaced with the deleteEntity(entity) methods. 
I found out, that we have to load entity every time we want to delete it. This entity must already exist in Hibernate Session. So this change doesn't bring any performance improvements, but makes the API simpler."
