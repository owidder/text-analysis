Update Hibernate to the 3.6.4 version	At the moment we use the 3.5.6 version. The new version introduces mostly bug fixes.		Task	iteraplan PO	08/May/11 6:12 PM	02/Sep/11 10:11 AM					hibernate									17/Jun/11 7:27 PM;smo;Issue that needs a workaround: in the new Hibernate Version the createClob method is deprecated. The best known workaround is by using annotations (more information here: http://opensource.atlassian.com/projects/hibernate/browse/HHH-5659), but since we use hbm files this fix is not possible.  I was not able to find another workaround yet. That is why attached to this ticket a patch with the changes I made for the migration can be found. 	27/Jun/11 6:14 PM;smo;The solution for the deprecated createClob method in Hibernate is to use the createClob from the LobHelper interface: session.getLobHelper().createClob(String value). But there appears another problem in working with clobs: one session and one StreamReader, which after the reading process is closed, are used. But in one of the implementations of the clobs, the XmiImporter, the clob needs to be read several times and the second time it fails at the reset procedure. A solution would need several changes in the implementation. Also there might appear other problems because of the update and other changes would be needed. That is why for the time being this update is postponed.	25/Aug/11 6:08 PM;sry;with the experiences made during Envers integration, it seems feasible now.	25/Aug/11 6:31 PM;sry;Tested (basically) on Oracle and MySQL with success. I will conduct a detailed comparison of the generated DB schemas later, to be sure that no DB migration is necessary (or create it)	29/Aug/11 3:07 PM;sry;Liquibase found now differences in the main schema after the library update. The Envers schema has changed and seems broken, but that has be dealt with as part of iteraplan ITERAPLAN-7.	02/Sep/11 10:11 AM;agu;Works both with MySQL and Oracle. The Saved Queries and <<null>> values are also functioning correctly.
