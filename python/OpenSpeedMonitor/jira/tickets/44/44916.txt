Non-hierarchical names on landscape diagram (PDF) axis labels	"At the moment, PDF and Visio exports of a landscape diagram show different labels on the axes. In PDF exports, the full hierarchical is shown (or at least the first few letters). This does not make too much sense as the hierarchy is obvious from the superordinate axis element, and all axis elements with the same parent seem to have the same name.

Instead, only the non-hierarchical name should be put into the label, like the Visio does it already. The should be no additional configuration option, because it would hardly be useful."
