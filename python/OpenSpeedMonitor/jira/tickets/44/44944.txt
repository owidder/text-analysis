Excel import may introduce new building block with name of existing one	"Following situation:

- Create Excel import file
- Create new building block with the name of an already existing building block of same type
- Assign the ID of an existing building block of same type to the newly created one
- Import the Excel file

Result:

- The Excel file is imported without complains
- There are two building blocks of same type with the same name
- Future modifications on one building block in the UI affects the other building block as well, e.g. renaming
- Future modifications on one building block from Excel import just affects the one building block"		Bug	iteraplan PO	19/May/11 7:45 AM	19/May/11 2:59 PM					excel	import								"19/May/11 2:31 PM;agu;This is relevant only for Information System and Technical Components Releases.
