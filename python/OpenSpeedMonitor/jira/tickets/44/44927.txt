Visualisations related to a single element (accessible via the visualisation tab)	"In case an element has not enough relations to other element for a certain type of graphic report the following error message is shown: ""This Building Block has no content of the selected type."". There seems to be only one exeption to this behaviour: if you choose the last pre-defined type for landscape diagram (technical landscape) you will receive an empty diagram if the required relations does not exist - instead of the expected error message. Therefore two improvement suggestions:
# to unify the behaviour by showing the same error message for the technical landscape as for the other types
# change the error message to be more instructive, e.g. ""Relations required for this type of diargram does not exist. Please maintain those and retry."" (the same in German)"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	11/May/11 11:18 AM	19/May/11 5:31 PM					diagram	landscape	reports						nightly Build-v2.9.SNAPSHOT-r13508 (2011-05-11-04-31-35)	19/May/11 5:31 PM;kvo;Reason is high effort for this
