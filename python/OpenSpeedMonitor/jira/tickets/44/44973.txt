Hibernate query exceeds Oracle SQL limitations for IN clauses	"The query executed by {code}GeneralBuildingBlockDAOImpl#LoadBuildingBlocksCallback{code} fails on Oracle databases if more than 1000 identifiers are passed in. The problem is that Oracle doesn't like more than 1000 elements in IN clauses (see Restrictions.in in code)

We have a generic helper method somewhere which makes sure that such long queries are properly broken into smaller pieces (dunno where a.t.m.)."		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/May/11 5:06 PM	10/Jun/11 2:55 PM					database	oracle
