Changing language while on a configuration page for a report can cause error-message saying a date was out of the allowed range	"example to reproduce:
1. go to Cluster Diagrams, choose some Information Systems and confirm your selection.
2. at step two of the configuration change the language
3. try to save => error

only happens with queries which are related to some kind of date, like the productive timespan of Information Systems, Projects or Technical Components.

Workaround: If you need to change the language while configuring a report, you can save the report in your current language settings, then close the flow, change language, and load the report in the new language to continue."
