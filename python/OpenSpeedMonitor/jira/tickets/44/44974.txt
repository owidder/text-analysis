Switching to second page shows unfiltered results on overview page, even though a filter is specified	"Reproduction:
# open an overview page, e.g. information systems
# filter for systems where *Name* *contains* free-text value *a*
# you should get a couple of dozen results. Remember that number
# set the page length to 10 matches
# switch to the second page. Compare the shown number of results with the number you remembered

Effectively, the second and all following pages are unfiltered again. That is why the number of matches seems to increase.

All pages should only show elements that match the filter, not only the first page."		Bug	iteraplan PO	30/May/11 2:51 PM	06/Oct/11 12:57 PM					filtering									"10/Aug/11 10:24 AM;agu;Good work. Unfortunately I found one small and one critical bug.

 * The controller (and service) classes should not have the state. For example the ArchitecturalDomainController has variable 
{code}
private PagedListHolder<ArchitecturalDomain> results;
{code}
This can cause the concurrency bugs. When 2 users use the search at the same time, one of them becomes bad results...
* When I switch to the second page, the result list does not changes. This apllies for user, user group, rolles, object related permission, and attribute lists. 

Improvements:
* Please improve the InformationSystemReleaseServiceTest.testGetInformationSystemReleasesBySearch() test method. The commented out code was checked in
* The search methods in controller classes look very similar (i.e. ArchitecturalDomainController.search(..) and BusinessDomainController.search(...)). Please refactor the code to remove duplications
* The methods ObjectRelatedPermissionController.nextORPPageToShow(...) and ObjectRelatedPermissionController.nextORPPageToShow(...) look identical. There are more of such methods in other controller classes. Please refactor to remove duplications.

I you need help, let me know :)"	21/Sep/11 10:46 AM;agu;The GuiSearchController still has a state. The resultList property should not be used in Controllers. See my comments above.	04/Oct/11 12:42 PM;vsh;Reset button doesn't work for user groups and roles. Otherwise everything else works.	06/Oct/11 12:57 PM;vsh;OK
