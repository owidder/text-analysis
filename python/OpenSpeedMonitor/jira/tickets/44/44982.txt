Enum Attribute detail description texts are not properly escaped for Javascript	"If an enum attribute value has a lengthy description, spanning several lines and including special chars, then the attribute details popup does not work on element detail pages. The Javascript for the details popup is broken. One indication seems to be that single quotes in the description text are not escaped. Also, the description text seems to be broken up into several strings. Maybe this happens because of wiki markup rendering?

In the attached screenshot, a click on *Details* does nothing, but the Firebug Console contains an error entry afterwards."		Bug	iteraplan PO	31/May/11 2:38 PM	29/Jun/11 4:11 PM					javascript									"15/Jun/11 5:04 PM;agu;Maybe is it possible to use StringEscapeUtils class from the Commons-Lang?
(see http://commons.apache.org/lang/api-2.5/org/apache/commons/lang/StringEscapeUtils.html)"	"20/Jun/11 3:16 PM;kgo;At least two cases in which the popup fails:

 * If single quotes are used in the attribute description for enumeration attributes (single quotes seem to be fine in the description of an attribute value though).
 * If a new multi-value enumeration attribute is created, and a value is set for a given information system, then in view mode the popup does not appear, yet in edit mode it does. Also, the popup appears in both modes as long as no value is assigned."	"22/Jun/11 10:30 AM;kgo;Several more remarks, the importance of which can be discussed:
* If the description of the attribute type contains triple curly brackets (wiki markup), the popup text is directly printed in the page. The same happens when using footnotes, text styling (% .. %) and headings.
* If the description of the attribute type contains double quotation marks, the popup is not displayed.
* In the case of multi-value attribute types with a set value the popup is not displayed in read mode, but it is displayed in edit mode."	27/Jun/11 11:02 AM;sfe;One minor remark: when using triple curly brackets in an attribute type's description, linebreaks within the so marked block will be displayed on the attribute type page, but not on the popups.
