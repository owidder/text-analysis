Layout for discrete positioning (enum - enum)	"*Philosophy:*

As less as possible whitespace by minimising quadrants.



*Summary:*

Implement new layout.



*Implementation Details:*

* The length of all sides is the same; we calculate the biggest side and take it for all others

* All quadrants are quadratic (and therefore the diagram is no longer quadratic)

* The size of quadrants (and of the whole diagram) is dynamically depending on the number of bubbles

* The biggest bubble range defines the size of the quadrant, i.e.

** discrete positioning (enum-enum):

*** -the size is ignored, e.g. if you have 5 big bubbles in one cell and 6 small bubbles in another cell, please take still the 6 small bubbles and the 5 big bubbles will overlap-

*** we use the average size between minimal and maximum size

*** check maximum number of bubbles in all quadrants

*** set size of quadrant so, that this maximum number of bubbles *in an average size* fits in

*** exception: if maximum number of bubbles is higher than 100, take 100 bubbles *in an average size* for the size of quadrant



* The size of bubbles is absolutely defined



* Url: nothing to do



*UI:*

* Legend: nothing to do

* Toolarea: nothing to do



*Two open points for the sprint Planning:*



*  Bubble min/max size, size of cell (number of bubbles in the cell)

*  Scaling min/max limits"	93345	Sub-task	iteraplan Speedbird	17/Aug/16 9:57 AM	23/Aug/16 2:20 PM														23/Aug/16 2:16 PM;roia;Reviewed: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-14
