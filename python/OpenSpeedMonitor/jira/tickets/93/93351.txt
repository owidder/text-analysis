Improve legend text for sizing	"*Summary:*

Legend text for sizing should be either next to bubbles (as-is) or within bubbles (for small zoom-factor)



*Implementation Details:*

* For big zoom-factors (please check fitting zoom-level): put legend-size-text within a bubble. If easily possible, let the text overlap over the borders of the circle otherwise the text is cut off

* For small zoom-factors: put legend-size-text next to the bubbles (as-is at the moment)

* Url: nothing to 



*UI:*

After analyzing GoJS code I noticed that for implementing this feature we need too many calculations for positioning text in the bubble, even then it may not work fine. 



So it was decided to leave current (common for all cases) implementation - text next to the bubble in the legend, before new ideas will appear."
