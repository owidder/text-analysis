Cache warnings for some changes made by plugins	"Timebox: 1d

_Reproduce (with sample data):_

# Create a number attribute ""Own Costs"" and assign it to Business Processes

# Assign the attribute ""Costs"" to Business Processes, too

# discover the attached plugin

# Change ""Costs"" or ""Own Costs"" value for a Business Process which has a parent.



The logfile or console should show one or more warnings similar to this one:

{noformat}

[WARN ] [2016-08-19 10:59:42] (internal.strategy.AbstractReadWriteEhcacheAccessStrategy) HHH020008: Cache[de.iteratec.iteraplan.model.attribute.AttributeValue] Key[de.iteratec.iteraplan.model.attribute.AttributeValue#799] Lockable[(null)]

A soft-locked cache entry was expired by the underlying Ehcache. If this happens regularly you should consider increasing the cache timeouts and/or capacity limits

{noformat}



The number of warnings seems to correlate with the number of ancestors whose Costs were changed by the plugin.



Please investigate and fix if possible."		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	19/Aug/16 11:20 AM	04/Oct/16 11:03 AM
