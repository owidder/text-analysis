Layout for exact positioning (num-num or num-enum)	"*Summary:*

Implement new layout for num-num or num-enum cases.



*Implementation Details:*

* The length of all sides is the same; we calculate the biggest side and take it for all others

* All quadrants are quadratic (and therefore the diagram is no longer quadratic)

* The size of quadrants (and of the whole diagram) is dynamically depending on the number of bubbles

* The biggest bubble range defines the size of the quadrant, i.e.

** exact positioning (num-num or num-enum):

*** count number of bubbles, where the centre is within the range of a quadrant

*** take this maximum number for the following calculation

*** Take ( sqrt(maximumNumber) * size in pixel of average bubble ) as length of all quadrants = side of cell

*** exception: if this maximum number is higher than 100, take 100 bubbles for the size of quadrant

* The size of bubbles is absolutely defined



* Url: nothing to do



*UI:*

* Legend: nothing to do

* Toolarea: nothing to do



*Two open points for the sprint Planning:*



*  Bubble min/max size, size of cell (number of bubbles in the cell)

*  Scaling min/max limits
