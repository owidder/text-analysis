LATER: AFTER-RELEASE: Extend personal Demo-System	"*Summary:*

Extend existing Personal-Demo-System to work with iteraplan version 5.2 and all following.



*As-Is:*

Personal Demo System does only work with all iteraplan versions until 5.1 because iteraplan 5.2 does no longer support multiple datasources for one application instance.

At the moment for every new user only one new database is created (*no* new application instance is deployed)



*To-Be:*

For every new user one new database is created *and* one new application instance is deployed.



*Implementation Details:*

* Extend the existing ""personaldemo""-web application (which generates and uses SQL and Shell-scripts)

* Use the existing MySQL-database on the iteraplan.de-server

* Remove old iteraplan application instances



* Discuss architecture and implementation with [~sfe]

* Link to the system: https://www.iteraplan.de/getiteraplandemo/register/init.do

* The source code can be checked out here: https://svn.iteratec.de/repos/projects/iteraplandemo"		Task	iteraplan Speedbird	16/Aug/16 5:19 PM	07/Nov/16 11:50 AM														"30/Aug/16 2:43 PM;sfe;It isn't mentioned in the ticket description, but the admin view of the application needs to be adjusted:

* Use the new database for the display of all demo instances

* Make at least an extension of the duration of demo instances possible. For that, the expiry date value in the database has to be updated and a new license key for that demo instance has to be created and imported.



I also suggest another improvement:

Currently, the database of a new demo instance is initialized by an SQL script that has to be provided for the demo-registration application ({{createInitialData.sql}})

Instead, the database initialization option of the iteraplan installer could be used.

This would mean one less dependency to files provided from ""outside""."	02/Sep/16 11:40 AM;fka;Created two sub tasks to implement the ideas
