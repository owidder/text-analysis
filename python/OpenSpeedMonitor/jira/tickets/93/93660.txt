Undeploy demo iteraplan instance	"Undeploy (and delete the data of the instance from the database) 120 days after the instance expired.

Some kind of cronjob will be needed, preferably from within the application. Running the job automatically once a week is sufficient."	93358	Sub-task	iteraplan Speedbird	19/Aug/16 3:35 PM	27/Sep/16 10:09 AM														"26/Sep/16 4:28 PM;sfe;Nevermind, it was my mistake: it works



\* Old comment *

It always returns an empty list for me, even with rows in the database that have an expiry date of one year ago."	"26/Sep/16 5:57 PM;sfe;Please create a follow-up ticket for handling of the ""cleanup"" after undeploying the application:

* dropping of demo instance databases

* deletion of log and index files/directories"	27/Sep/16 10:09 AM;sfe;Open items to do will be done in IPTS-182
