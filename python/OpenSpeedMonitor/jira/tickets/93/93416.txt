Reactor Config does not work in lite edition	It is not possible in the lite edition, to save a config for a reactor script (see screenshot). This is probably because the rest ressource /api/reactor/configs is not included in the file "[ClassicCLientProject]\config\customization\lite\WebContent\WEB-INF\applicationContext-rest.xml".
