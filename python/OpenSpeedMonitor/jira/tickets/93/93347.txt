Font size of axes depending on size of sections	"*Summary:*

Make font size of axes depending on the sections



*Implementation Details:*

* Increase/decrease font size of axes to use major space of a section (on X-axes)

* It is initially calculated and not changed during zoom

* Font size over all axes is the same

* mapping table: 0-100 pixel per section => font size ""small""

** 101 pixel - 200 pixel => font size ""medium""

** 201 pixel - 300 pixel => font size ""large""

** ...

* Url:nothing to do



*UI:*

* Legend: nothing to do

* Toolarea: nothing to do

As I suppose, full mapping table should be:

0-100 - small

101-200 - medium

201-300 - large

301-400 - x-large

400+ - xx-large

Please, could you confirm that assumption?



[4:00:41 PM] kainzinger: the mapping table makes sense for me
