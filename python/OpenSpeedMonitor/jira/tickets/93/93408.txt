PAPI - Performance improvement	"Don't calculate diffs and performe model merge every time the plugin component recieves event. 

Do it only if the model was actually changed.

Add dirty flag to flatModel, check it in recieveEvent"		Improvement	iteraplan Thunderduck	17/Aug/16 9:38 AM	17/Aug/16 3:24 PM
