Update toolarea to handle additional date intervals	"Toolarea:

Main entry: ""Addtional date intervals""

First sub-entries: ""Level 1"", ""Level 2"" (if exists), ""Level 3"" (if exists)

Sub-sub-entry: All available date intervals (=duration attributes) ordered alphabetically

The actual selected date interval is highlighted in bold

When you re-click on an already selected date interval, this date interval is removed from the diagram

You cannot remove all date intervals, i.e. one date interval is at least selected
