REST-calls ignore time of date-time-attributes	"*Summary:*

REST-calls ignore time of date-time-attributes, e.g.



{

  ""query"": ""InformationSystem[@lastModificationTime\u003c\u003d\""Mon Jun 06 00:00:00 CEST 2016\""]"",

  ""result"": []

}



iteraQl does not ignore it, which is the desired behaviour.



Please fix this - only for Modification Time. All other date attributes and the handling of them stay as they are."
