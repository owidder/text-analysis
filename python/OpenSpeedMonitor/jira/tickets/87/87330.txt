Filter does not behave well on intermediate language switch	"See comment from [~ach] in ITERAPLAN-4511:

*Reproduce:*

# keep english language

# set a single filter (e.g. with ""between"" operator)

# close dialog window

# change language to german

# open filter dialog window again

# operator name is still in english.



Comment by [~abo]:

However, when you switch the language several times, this usecase is working / translation is done correctly with already set filters.



*SHOULD:*

* after switching language, and opening the filter dialog, the dialog itself uses the selected language

* the values in drop-downs are translated, too

* for already configured filters, their drop-down-values are translated, AND the dropdowns show the previously selected values in the selected language"		Bug	iteraplan PO	15/Jun/16 2:10 PM															15/Jun/16 2:11 PM;abo;This issue is the follow-up to ITERAPLAN-4511
