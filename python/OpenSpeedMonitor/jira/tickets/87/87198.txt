Replace patched angular-bootstrap-colorpicker with the bower_component	"CSS is already taken from the bower_components.



Adjusting in the diagram controllers needed that control the colorpicker.



-----

The ideal outcome is that we use both an official and modern release of the component, have it in Bower/Nexus, and do no longer need patches.



Next to ideal is to have corrections and adaptations in a way that does not modifiy the code of the component, but in the code _using_ the component.



As a way to reach this, but not as a goal on its own, is to replace the color picker component with a different color picker, from material for example."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	14/Jun/16 6:39 PM
