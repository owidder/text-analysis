Remove Bootstrap dependency and add angular-material styling	"Remove magic-bootstrap*.(css|less) files.

----

The magic-bootstrap.* files are generated by a bootstrap customizer/theming tool.

 Unfortunately, the input in that tool is lost, because we did not save that input file.

 The non.-css files (less etc.) are not used and will not be used.



If all general-purpose parts of the UI are moved towards a single and modern visual and technical basis, say material for example, the bootstrap components such as buttons will be replaced, and bootstrap including the files in question are unused.



As long as we still use boostrap components (via angular strap or directly) we could check if they are styled via magic bootstrap, or in another way, more directly, and remove magic-bootstrap at once, even before removing bootstrap itself.
