Can the sorting behaviour after deletion of column be improved?	"At the moment, the behaviour of the list is as follows



* The user sorts the data by a specific column

* The user deletes this column

* The list data is automatically be re-sorted by the first visible column



As a user, I would expect that the order of the list items stays the same if I delete a column. Otherwise I have to search the whole list again for the item I was looking at and this can be annoying especially in long lists.



Two questions:



# Is my desired behaviour really what other users want or is it just me?

# If it is *not* just me, is the improvement of the sorting behaviour technically feasible on a reasonable timescale?"

Don't implement this improvement.
