Verify no XSS is possible via URL-config-deserialization	"Especially in the context of filters and lists, verify that _queryProcessor.readUrlAsObject()_ (queryprocessor.js) does not deserialize function-code, which may lead to XSS or XSRF vulnerabilities.



Write Tests that proof that no injection is possible.



*Background information:* the list configuration uses JSON obejcts for its configuration, before a code-change those objects, including a complete comparator implementation, was serialized to URL. At that point in time, I couldn't verify whether the complete comparator was de-serialized when opening the URL.
