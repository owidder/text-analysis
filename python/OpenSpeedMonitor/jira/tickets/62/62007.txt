make startScreenDialog closeable & set timeout	"In rare cases, when the data model is loaded very quickly, the loading screen in the new client doesn't close anymore.

Please fix by delaying the closing of the dialog. ~1 second should be enough.

To be sure also make the loading screen manually closable."		Bug	iteraplan PO	30/Oct/15 11:44 AM	02/Nov/15 8:54 AM
