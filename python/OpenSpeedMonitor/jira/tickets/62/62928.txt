- you need an absolute path to the file to check its content BUT the file name contains a time stamp and so it is different every time

- you need to delete the file afterwards to not aggregate 10000000 files but you need the path (see problem 1). do you even have rights to delete a file?

- no possibility to configure protractor to work with all browsers together with phantomjs / jenkins (?)

- what's the download path when jenkins executes the test?

- assuming you have access to the downloaded file, how to check if the content is what we want?"
