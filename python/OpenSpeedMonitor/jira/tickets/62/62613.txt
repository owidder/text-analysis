Diagrams in Interactive Client should handle missing permissions gracefully	"Examples of current state (based on sample data and user which is not allowed to see Information System Domains):

* Startscreen: Tile for Information System Domains shows the translation key

* Building block list: Clicking on tile for Information System Domains shows ugly JSON fragments

* NCD: Shows ugly JSON fragments



Reason for all this is that with missing read permissions for a type like Information System Domain, said type is not contained in the metadata sent to the client.



These cases need to be handled to avoid showing broken screens."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	05/Nov/15 9:55 AM	19/Nov/15 4:37 PM					permissions									11/Nov/15 10:46 AM;msr;[~fka] : *Small solution as possible!*
