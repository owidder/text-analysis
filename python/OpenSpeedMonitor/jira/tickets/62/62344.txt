Remove property "sv.group" from iteraplan-auth.properties	"This property ""sv.group"" is important at install time to initialize the superuser group in the database, but the entry in iteraplan-auth.properties doesn't seem to be used by iteraplan.



When this is true, the property should be removed from the iteraplan-auth.properties.template files (all customizations!) and from the build process, because it is rather confusing."
