Permission handling in NCD	"* First, refactor the ""defaultInnerType"" and ""defaultOuterType"" information from {{app/js/common/typesDefinitions.js}} into a ""ncdPresets.js"" or similar object/file in the ncd specific folder.

* In {{controller.ncd.js}} there is the function {{checkNCDTypes}}, where the default configuration for NCD seems to be set

** Instead of using plain ""InformationSystem"" as default inner type, provide a orderes list of types to try and use the first of those which is available. That list should be provided by the above mentioned ""ncdPresets"". For the ordering of the types, talk to [~sfe]

** If no type is available, show a ""diagram could not be displayed due to permissions"" screen instead of the (broken) diagram.

** Change the ""defaultInnerType"" and ""defaultOuterType"" in ""ncdPresets"" to an array of types and use the first of those types which is available.

** The last entry in the ""default*Type"" arrays should always be the originating type itself."	62613	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	05/Nov/15 10:16 AM	19/Nov/15 4:37 PM														"12/Nov/15 3:06 PM;dam;are ng-ifÂ´s one after another in diagramLegendAttributes.template.svg neccesary
