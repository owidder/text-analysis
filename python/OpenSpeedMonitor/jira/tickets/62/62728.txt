Relation aggregation with active hierarchy filters doesn't work	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_

# Open LSD in new client

# Select ""Connected Business Process"" as one of the axis assignments

# Select ""Show with hierarchy level"" - ""only level 1""



_Expected:_

Only three axis elements are shown (the top level business processes), and the content elements assigned to their children are shown for the respective top level element.



_Actual:_

Diagram is empty, but only when the client is deployed in the uglified variant."		Bug	iteraplan PO	06/Nov/15 12:49 PM	09/Nov/15 8:57 AM
