for filterType determination use only presentation type	"at the moment in NCD are 2 different check methodes to determine the filterType.

1. presentationType

2. -check the filterValue for "":"" -> num/date  than check for ""d"" -> date; 

    -shouldnÂ´t we have "":"" the value must be text/num ...



the whole diagram should work with presentationType"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	05/Nov/15 8:57 AM	19/Jan/16 4:20 PM
