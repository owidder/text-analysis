Permission handling in LSD	"In LSD, when setting configuration from the default configuration:

* Check whether the default content type is visible. If not use the next available type from a predefined list as content type

* For each default axis assignment check whether the according type is visible. If not, use a ""dummy"" type instead, displaying a ""click to select row|column assignment"" message.

* Clicking the according axis description opens the axis tool area as usual, offering the selection of relations or attributes according to the selected content type.

* The tool area code should not be changed. If that is not possible, please talk to [~sfe]. Instead, the dummy type should be as close as possible to a ""real type"" so the tool area code works with it.

* Do not change the datamodel. If necessary, introduce methods into the lsd data service which does necessary special case treatment for the dummy types and in other cases calls the data service.

* The diagram generation code should be changes as little as possible."	62613	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	05/Nov/15 2:33 PM	18/Nov/15 2:13 PM														16/Nov/15 10:58 AM;dam;there was a wrong commit. commit 1899 is in ITERAPLAN-4108	18/Nov/15 2:13 PM;tam;The follow-up ticket was created: ITERAPLAN-4179
