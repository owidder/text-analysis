Clean up LSD diagram item implementation and usage	"Examples of issues I've noticed for axis items:



* Axis items have, among other fields, literalOf, name, persistentName, displayValue and aggregatedNames. Are all those necessary?

* There are a few places where the code using those items checks whether it's an enumeration or not by checking the persistent name of one or all axis items, although we know all items in the same axis are of the same kind.

* Even as late as in the table builder there are differences in handling of the items with regards to their localization. Example:

{noformat}

text: (currentXAxisGroupElement.literalOf) ?

        translate.instant(mmTranslateKey([currentXAxisGroupElement.literalOf, ""literals"", currentXAxisGroupElement.persistentName])) :

        (currentXAxisGroupElement.displayValue ? currentXAxisGroupElement.displayValue : currentXAxisGroupElement.name),

{noformat}

* Variable names are often ""bo"" centric, suggesting axis items can only be business objects. This is not true anymore.



To do:

* Change variable names to correctly express what they can hold.

* Generally fix/add JS doc where applicable

* Change information contained in axis items and, accordingly, their usage:

** Aim is to remove the necessity for conditional code with respect to the axis items content where possible

** Axis items should have:

*** displayValue. If there is something to use translate on, then do it here, during building of the axis item. The display value should contain exactly the text which will be displayed on the diagram later.

*** name: This is an identifier for the axis items. This should be the name of the business object or the persistent name of the enumeration literal or the string representation of the date the axis item represents.

*** aggregatedNames: Basically the same as now. The names of all descendants of the current axis item which are not displayed themselves due to hierarchy filter (simplified explanation). Including its own name.

** Usage examples of the fields:

*** name: to refer to an axis item in the code (like in maps you may build)

*** aggregatedNames: to establishing the assignments to content elements and related calculations

*** displayValue: for display, just as it is.

** Try to avoid the need to distinguish treatment of the axis item based on whether it represents a business object or enum literal or date value. If that is not possible, write the information what kind of axis it is into the axis object, not the axis item objects.

* Check whether there are similar issues/fixes for content items.
