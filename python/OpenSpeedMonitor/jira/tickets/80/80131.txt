Keep user visualization selection	"Hello,



In Iteraplan 5.1, user might select the columns/attributes he wants to display when browsing applications, business functions, ...

Unfortunately when the session ends this selection is lost. When coming back to the application view, the default columns are displayed.



Is there a way to keep those user settings?



Thanks,

unfortunately there is currently no way to keep those user settings.
However, we are planning to add user-specific settings like these to the interactive client of iteraplan.
I cannot provide you with an ETA when this will be implemented, though.

Best regards,
