Add REST interface	"As an adjacent system I want to access the iteraplan Graphics Reactor's functions via REST:

* upload / download / delete a single file

* get a file list of a specific directory within the reactor

* create and delete directories

* start a script, get the log of the execution

* Configure ""Saved queries before"" 



The functionality above is the same as the one that the interactive Client uses, so it could be the same resource in the REST API.



Here included:

* documentation for the system integrator

* a simple example (script with wgets for example).
