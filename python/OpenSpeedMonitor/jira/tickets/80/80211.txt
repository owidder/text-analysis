Remove test-relevant code from production-code	"check if up to date

*IS:*
Some js-objects define the method _injectBuildersForPipelineIntegrationTest()_, i.e. _lsdMain.js, ifdContentMain.js, ncdContentMain.js_ which is (should be) used for tests only.

*SHOULD:*
Methods that are used in tests only, should not be available in production code.

*Hints:*
I see two possible solutions:
# use the appropriate properties to set the diagram-builder and the graph-builder.
# define the method in a js-file that is loaded together with all the other tests (but not in a single test-spec-file, because it would force a certain test execution order)."
