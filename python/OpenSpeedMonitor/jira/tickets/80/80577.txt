Publish script results via URL	"As an iteraplan user I want to access the result of a reactor script via a URL.



UI components for configuration: IPTQ-43



Make the following sequence work:

# The user calls the configured URL (.../api/reactor/hugo)

## Check if there is a script configured under this URL -> No -> *404*

## Check if the logged in user is in one of the configured roles -> No -> *403*

## Check if the result file is there

### Yes: Check cache time limit. Is the configured result file older (result file creation time) than the cache time (e.g. older than 10 hours) ? execute the script (with possibly configured saved queries) and return the freshly generated result file : *return the result file*

### No: execute the script and return the freshly generated result file.

If there is no generated result file return *204 (No Content)*.



If the cache time is exceeded and the reactor is busy -> *202* with message ""Cache time of output file exceeded but reactor is busy right now. Please try again later."""

But the request to the server will be executed under a specific role. This role should be used.	28/Jul/16 12:48 PM;mwe;Roles can contain commas. [~fka] said we shall split the roles at commas and if this splits a role name the role will have to be renamed.	01/Aug/16 6:25 PM;tsu;The commit 25701 belongs to the ticket IPTQ-26
