Features of new client	"We are trying to use the new interactive client to create cluster diagrams.  I was not able to find the release notes for the next 5.2 version.  Would you be so kind as to tell me whether the following features will be addressed in the next version.



1. Ability to change the default color of the outer elements.



2. Faster upload when switching back-and-forth between the new client and the classic client.  For example, while viewing a diagram in the new client, i noticed a wrong relationship in the data.  Simple, went back to the classic client and made the correction.  Then when returing to the new client I have to wait 2.5 minutes for the download.  That is ok once, but not repeatedly.



3. Ability to save the configuration used to create a diagram, i.e. the options selected from the context menu.  Currently, these options have to be re-selected every time a diagram is updated.



thank you, hannes
