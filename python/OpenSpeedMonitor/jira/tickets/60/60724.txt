Include image data directly in SVG export	"Adjust the client-side SVG creation in a way, that images are included as base64 enocded data inside the <image>'s ""href"" attribute.



From:

{code}

<image xlink:href=""https://IMAGE_URI"" >>

{code}



To:

{code}

<image xlink:href=""data:image/jpeg;base64,BASE64_ENCODED_DATA"" />

{code}



The best solution would be to include the data URIs already in the static javascript file(s) like ""commons/typeDefinitions.js"". A little (Node.js?) script would be useful to perform the conversion from image data to data URIs (from one file to another)."
