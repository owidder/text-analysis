Classic Landscape Diagram: IT-Service on axes is not possible	"*Summary:*

It's not possible to put IT-Services on axes of the classic Landscape Diagram.



*Reproduce:*

* Open a classic lanscape diagram

* Select ""Information System"" as content element

* Select ""IT Service"" as column association



*Actual:*

You get Business Processes instead of IT Services as columns.



*Expected:*

You get IT Services as columns.



The same applies to the Y-axis.







*_+Just another issue in the same context:+_*

When the content type is ""Technical Components"" and an axis type (row or column) is ""IT Service"", then the diagram cannot be saved. This error does NOT occur, if the content type is ""InformationSystems"". The reason for this issue is most likely the missing ""ITSERVICE"" literal in ""/WebContent/WEB-INF/classes/schemas/LandscapeDiagramXML.xsd"" in the enumeration ""typeXML""."
