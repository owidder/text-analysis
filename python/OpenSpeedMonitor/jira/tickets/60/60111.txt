The return value of a function in dataModel behaves as object and array simultaneously	"When one calls the getMinMaxByJson function the JSDoc promises the return value would be an Array.

This actually is true; nontheless the returned value also behaves like an object which contains keys and respective values (cf. the attached screenshot).

There are two possibilities how this misbehaviour can be fixed:

# Do not initialize the return value as array and adapt the JSDoc accordingly (preferred option according to SFE)

# Adapt the return value and treat it as an array consequently"		Bug	iteraplan PO	14/Oct/15 11:32 AM	04/Nov/15 3:19 PM														"04/Nov/15 1:02 PM;dam;decide for the first possibility.

itÂ´s the easiest way to fix this misbehaviour and i think an object is in this function the right data structure to store persistentNames with there min&max values"
