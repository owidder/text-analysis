Wrong direction during import of new interfaces without transported business object	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_

* Export Excel Data from iteraplan

* Modify Excel file:

** Add new line in Information Flow sheet:

*** Set ""Assigned Interface"" to ""\[new interface\]""

*** Set Connected Information System 1 and 2 to valid information system names

*** Set Direction to ""BOTH_DIRECTIONS""

*** Leave ""Transported Business Object"" empty

** Add new line in Interface sheet

*** Set ""Name"" to ""\[new interface\]""

*** Set ""Interface Direction"" to ""FIRST_TO_SECOND""

* Import the resulting file



_Expected:_ New Interface created between the two selected Information Systems. Interface does not have a name. Interface direction is from first Information System to the second Information System



_Actual:_ Direction is ""BOTH_DIRECTIONS"" due to a special case treatment for information flows without business object."		Bug	iteraplan PO	19/Oct/15 1:34 PM	21/Oct/15 1:28 PM					import	interfaces
