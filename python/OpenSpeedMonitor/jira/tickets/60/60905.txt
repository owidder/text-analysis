Make 'switch client'-button in the classic client context-sensitive, too	"As described at http://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan51/New+Client , the button in the interactive client is context-sensitive.



At the moment, we have different buttons in the classic client. In this ticket, you should adapt the behaviour of the interactive client's button to the one in the classic client and delete the unnecessary buttons in the classic client.



*Concrete:*

* change behaviour of ""switch to interactive client""- button on top right of every page of the classic client and make it context-sensitive

* remove ""visualize in interactive client""-button in LSD, NCD & IFD

* Ensure the context-sensitive button from the Building Block lists links to the interactive Building Block Lists and *not* the interactive start screen





Behaviour should be equal to the button in the new client (see link above)."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	21/Oct/15 10:07 AM	11/Nov/15 11:09 AM					gui	usability
