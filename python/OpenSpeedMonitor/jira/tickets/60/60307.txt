"Scaling" in Portfolio Diagram doesn't affect Status	"_Reproduce (with bank data):_

# Configure a Portfolio Diagram for the type Information System

# Filter Information Systems, so that at least one of the status values does not appear in the result set

# Select Status as one of the axes in the diagram

# Select ""Scaling (local context)"" in advanced settings

# Create diagram



_Expected:_ As with user-defined enumeration attributes, the attribute values for which there aren't elements to be displayed do not appear on the diagram axis

_Actual:_ All status values are always shown on the axis"		Bug	iteraplan PO	15/Oct/15 10:53 AM	11/Nov/15 10:30 AM
