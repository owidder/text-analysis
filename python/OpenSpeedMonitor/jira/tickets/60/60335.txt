Import: Improve validation for "delete and recreate" case	"Situation:

# Import with overwrite strategy

# Import attempts to delete some building blocks

# Import attempts to create some building blocks with names of building blocks marked for deletion



In this case the validation step acts as if this is possible.

In step 5 of the import, however, a unique constraint validation happens.



Expected:

Validation (step 4) reports the situation in a clear manner as invalid and prevents the import from attempting step 5."
