LSD Hierarchy Filter doesnÂ´t work with customer example data	"*Reproduce*

with big customer data in lsd.

open LSD;

selecte Business Process for the x axis

enter a hierarchy filter like ""all levels""



*Expect*

x-axis shows hierarchy



*Actual*

nothing happen with an error message



*Problem*

parcial cuts the axis elements.

for hierarchy display we go with an loop threw all axis elements an check there descendents an pick them out of all axis elements. this cant happen by an cut axis"		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/Nov/15 8:18 AM	22/Dec/15 10:20 AM														"03/Dec/15 5:52 PM;ach;Correction: the below does not apply, the necessary changes were much simpler.

- you dont need large data for reproducing this error: just set Constants.LSD.PARTIAL.CONTENT to small value (e.g. 20)

- error caused by calculateColumnSpan() in lsdTableBuilder.js, because  currentAxisItem.descendants contains all descendants of currentAxisItem (even if they were removed by partial)

- after discussion with wfr, dam, sfr we need some changes in axesItems structure. 

- Sfr's idea is on the screenshot"	"04/Dec/15 11:32 AM;wfr;Correction: the below does not apply, the necessary changes were much simpler

todo as of discussion Fr. SFe WFr



important and not yet met:

* the axis elements must be on the correct level, even after the cut for parital rendering

* a group of axis elements must have a width or height that corresponds to the number of actually displayed descendants, even after the cut.





changes to meet the items above



* an axis item should know its parent

* we have two different things that make up an axis structure: real items and group items.

* a leaf item, that is without children, results in a pair of real item and single-item-group, containing only itself

* an inner node item results in a real item"	14/Dec/15 1:10 PM;dam;commit 2113 is not necessary. is should be reverted
