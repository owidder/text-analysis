New enum attribute type with "add via LDAP" capability	"Build a new enum attribute type, with search and add capability via LDAP. With this new type an iteraplan user should be able to add a value to this enum via searching it in LDAP and selecting it - while editing a building block.



Sounds cool? - It is!



The LDAP connection to be used should be the one configured for user authentication. Implement (only) in the New Client.



On the attribute configuration page: Configuration like the classic enum type with one additional field: LDAP query string



On the client, in the element view/edit screen: Besides the ""classical"" enum editing possibilities (choose from a list) a button ""search in LDAP"". Clicking this button should bring up a dialog where the use can enter a search string. Clicking a button ""Search"" will do an LDAP search based on the configured LDAP query string and the entered search term appended to it. The results will be presented to the user (limit to 100). The user can then choose a value from the list (""ok""), leave the dialog (""Cancel"") or search again.



When the user leaves the dialog with Ok, the chosen value will be added to the available values of the respective enum. Yes, this is a metamodel change. The value should also be immediately shown to the user, the edit mode of the respective element be ended. This means the chosen value should be saved as new value for the enum-



When leaving the dialog via Cancel, the enum should stay in edit mode."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	24/Nov/15 5:00 PM						attribute	enum	ldap
