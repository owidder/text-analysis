Refactoring of metamodel.js	"adjust existing functionality for useing new metamodel implementation as far as possible



"	63140	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	20/Nov/15 11:19 AM	03/Dec/15 1:54 PM														"23/Nov/15 4:01 PM;ach;tried to reimplement getMetaTypeDefinition() -> this methode is used on several places in code (thereby some of them should use getFeaturesListByName insetad of getMetaTypeDefinition). 

so refactoring of getMetaTypeDefinition causes refatoring of other methods, which should be refactored too. 

Is it not the better way to define a new fixed API, implement it in dataModel.js and use it consistently instead of switching old functionality to new implementation (method by method) and adjust it's usage?"	"27/Nov/15 8:25 AM;dam;should metaModel be in use at all diagramms, delete enumBy() in metaModel.js

"	01/Dec/15 3:46 PM;dam;adjust of exisiting functionality is no longer important. we made a "hard" refactoring and adjust the diagrams directly.	03/Dec/15 1:54 PM;ach;[~dam] commited to ITERAPLAN-4162
