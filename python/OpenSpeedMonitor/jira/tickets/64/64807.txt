Composite Pie Chart Error with full circles	"Reproduce:

# Create a pie diagram configuration for Information Systems, showing maintenance of the attribute ""Status"" which should result in a full green circle shown.

# Save the configuration

# Create a composite pie/bar chart, selecting a saved bar diagram as first, and the pie diagram from above as second diagram shown



_Expected:_ both diagrams correctly displayed, Bar diagram first, Pie diagram below



_Actual:_ Bar diagram displayed correctly, but the full green circle of the Pie diagram is displayed too high, overlapping the Bar diagram."		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/Nov/15 10:17 AM	27/Nov/15 11:29 AM					composite	pie
