LSD: cannot change axis to enum attribute	"reproduction:

- click on an axis in lsd and try to change attribute to complexity



expected:

- axis changes to complexity



actual:

- nothing happens and double layered menu stays as it is (you can click infinite times on ""Complexity"")

- if you close the menu and reopen it again ""Complexity"" is highlighted and clickable again (after the click the axis finally changes to complexity)"		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/Nov/15 9:39 AM	02/Dec/15 9:24 AM					LSD
