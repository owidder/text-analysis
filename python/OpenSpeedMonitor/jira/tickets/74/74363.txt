Adapt aspect ratio to A format landscape 	"Adapt the layout of the diagram so that it has an aspect ration similar to an DIN A format in landscape orientation.



For both inner and outer elements, choose the wrapping column so that there is an equal number or rows and columns, where the last row may be partially empty.

Based on an A format aspect ratio of the shapes within, and ignoring padding, title and legend, the overall shape has A format as well.



Example: 1 element = > 1x1

2 elements: 1 x 2   or   2 x 1

3 => 2 x 2

4 => 2 x 2

5, 6 => 3 x 2

7, 8, 9 => 3 x 3

...



The (outer) grid should have different widths and heights for each column and row, resp.

So a wide element in grid cell sets the width for all cells in the same columns, but not for all cells of the grid. In the same way, a tall cell sets the height of the row, but not for all cells.



Elements should be top left aligned in their cells. Smaller elements leave a gap to the right and bottom to the adjacent element. This is different from the NCD in the Classic Client, where the elements are aligned in a ""line of text"" way from left to right.



The basic innermost element should be a colored box with three lines of text and icon, and approximately landscape A format aspect ratio."	76610	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	22/Feb/16 3:00 PM	18/Mar/16 9:42 AM														18/Mar/16 9:42 AM;sfe;Is part of ITERAPLAN-4389 and nothing to be added to the layout separately.
