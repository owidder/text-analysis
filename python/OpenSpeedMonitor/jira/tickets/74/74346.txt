xAxis height in LSD not correct when hierarchy level e.g. "only level 3"	"Reproduction:

- in LSD change x Axis to connected business processes

- show with hierarchy level ""only level 3"" (also with ""only level 2"" and 1 )



Expected:

- the height of the xAxis title and the height of the xAxisgroups is the same (just change the size of the box)



Actual:

- the height of the xAxisgroups is greater"		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	22/Feb/16 1:28 PM	25/Jul/16 12:12 PM					LSD									25/Jul/16 12:12 PM;dmkh;Review is done: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-84.
