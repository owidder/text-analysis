Seperate creation of single filter objects by dialog and URI	"Problem:



2 ways to build a XSingleFilter



    (1) as a combination of the parts: type, property, operator, and value

    (2) parsing its part of the URI / location string: one argument (plus injections)



(1) is the primary way, so this is the real (and only) constructor function



(2) cannot be a constructor, because there can only be one.



(2) can be a static factory function of the class XSingleFilter



(2) should be function of XSingleFilter, so that the knowledge about the structure for serializing and deserializing is in the same class.



(2) needs to transform the parameters as given by the URI into objects (property, operator and values if necessary)
