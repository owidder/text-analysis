Changing Entity Names	"Hi all, 



we are trying to configure iteraplan in order to change the names of the entities on the landing page (meta-model). We have attempted to change ""Product"" to ""Business Continuity Services"" and have followed the following steps:



To change the names of building blocks do the following:



1.      Open the file below in any text editor

[tomcat folder on your system]\webapps\iteraplan\WEB-INF\classes\de\iteratec\iteraplan\presentation\resources\ApplicationResources.properties



2.      Change ALL occurrences of the name you are going to replace



3.      Store the file under another name, e.g. “ApplicationRessourcesCustomCSIR.properties”  in the folder:

[tomcat folder on your system]\webapps\iteraplan\WEB-INF\classes\de\iteratec\iteraplan\presentation\resources\Custom\



4.      Restart Tomcat



 

However, we have done this and Iteraplan is not loading. Please assist. 

We have uploaded the custom file that we have made for you to verify. 



Regards,
