Input field ""Output Filename"" in the config modal:

* The error message when an invalid file name is inserted is misleading (""Please use alphanumeric characters for the file name."")

* It must be possible to insert a full path



Otherwise, no problems found during review."	08/Aug/16 2:45 PM;mwe;Fixed the regex (including extraction to the Constants) and changed the error message.	"09/Aug/16 12:10 PM;mse;I find the error message for the output file field still confusing. E.g. when I enter ""asdasd"" (which is missing a file extension), I get:

{{There are illegal characters in the path name. The file name has to contain only alphanumeric characters and has to have a file extension (e.g. '.xml'). Please avoid the following characters: / \ : * ? "" < > |}}



What about:

{{Please enter a valid path and file name. The file name has to contain only alphanumeric characters and has to have a file extension (e.g. '.xml').}}



As the path name is already checked when a new folder is created, I think this would be sufficient."	09/Aug/16 1:27 PM;mwe;Removed the output file name pattern because it does more harm than it is useful.	09/Aug/16 1:30 PM;mse;Review ok now.
