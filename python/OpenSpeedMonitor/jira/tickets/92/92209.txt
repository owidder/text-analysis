Numeric AV changes are not written to ReactionEvents	"Timebox: 0.5 days?



Changes of numeric attributes (e.g. costs) are not propagated to the ReactionEvents. This is due to the fact that Hibernate sends PostUpdateEvents for numeric AVAs and not a Delete and an Insert event as for other AVAs.



In addition, the following cache error is shown, when costs are changed (not sure if this is connected though...):



[WARN ] [2016-08-02 11:00:48] (internal.strategy.AbstractReadWriteEhcacheAccessStrategy) HHH020008: Cache[de.iteratec.iteraplan.model.attribute.AttributeValue] Key[de.iteratec.iteraplan.model.attribute.AttributeValue#816] Lockable[(null)]

A soft-locked cache entry was expired by the underlying Ehcache. If this happens regularly you should consider increasing the cache timeouts and/or capacity limits

The warning mentioned in the ticket description, is not caused by the ReactionEventListener or the Plugin-API and seems not to cause any problems -> can be ignored."
