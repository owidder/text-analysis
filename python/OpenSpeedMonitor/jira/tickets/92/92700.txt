Improve wrapping	"1. Always ""active"" without a left click on the header, i.e.

* Ensure, that it is always ""active"" without any click: Immediately highlight the border line in the header and change the mouse icon



2. Always show light grey column grid line in the dataDiagram (see Screenshot)



3. Improve interaction with the resizer:

* If the columns are more narrow (by changing the column width), change the column widht of the whole DataDiagram with the help of the resizer, i.e. there exists no white space

* Set the minimum column width for the column wrapping and for the resizing of the whole data diagram to 10 pixel.
