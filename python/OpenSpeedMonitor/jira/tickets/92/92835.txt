Properties files for languaje	"Dear Support,



I'm going to modify an iteraplan instance for MUC HYP, with two new properties files.



ApplicationResourcesCustomMucHyp_de.properties

ApplicationResourcesCustomMucHypMM_de.properties



Could you please confirm to which folder and which files I have to modify?

thank you for your enquiry. 

Both files must be copied in following path:

""....\[Tomcat]\webapps\[iteraplan directory]\WEB-INF\classes\de\iteratec\iteraplan\presentation\resources"".

First of all, thanks for your support.
Could you please confirm me how can I check after restarting the Tomcat if the files I added are having a good behavior insid the application?

Regards,"	"16/Aug/16 8:43 AM;cst;Dear Sir / Madam,

thanks for your Reply.

We updated two names from the Building Block Types in iteraplan.
Here was standing ""$"" instead of ""&"" in the customized properties. 

When you start iteraplan, the following Building Block Types  ""Applikation"" and ""Technologie""  will be shown correctly.

Mr. Metko from the MÃ¼nchener Hypothekenbank contacted us.

At the moment iteraplan doesnt show the customized Building Block Type Names. 



Would you please replace the folder ""resources"" with the attached folder on the path



[^resources.zip]



""[Tomcat]\webapps[iteraplan directory]\WEB-INF\classes\de\iteratec\iteraplan\presentation\"".



and restart your tomcat. When iteraplan starts, you see following start screen.
