TODO

* Currently the feature name is the $location.path() of the feature. There should be any mapping between the path and the feature name in the client constants.js

** Please keep is consistent like this:

*** lists/BUILDING_BLOCK_TYPE (list/InformationSystem, list/ITService, ...)

*** diagram/DIAGRAM_NAME (diagram/NCD, diagram/MPD)

* Load setting on diagram page loading (should be similar to the lists but has to be done for every diagram)

* Implement saving language change in user settings

* Load language on page load

** What happens with language that is in the URL? - Possibly remove it from the URL because with the user settings it is unnecessary.

* Create new method resetSettingsToDefault() that resets the page to the default settings(queryProcessor.setParametersToUrl({}))

* Connect the ""RESET VIEW""-Button to the resetSettingsToDefault() function in the service.



DONE:

* Add service that stores the user settings within the service

* Load setting on list page loading (see ListConfiguration)"	24/Aug/16 12:59 PM;pma;The commits 4155, 4156, 4157 and 4158 relate to this the subtask IPTQ-123
