Reactor - Problem with saving Query Ids	"Summary: The Id´s of a saved query can not be saved when only the option ""Execute saved queries prior to the script"" is used.



Reproduce:

◾ Open Reactor

◾ Upload a XML-File 

◾ Click on ""Edit"" and activate the checkbox ""Execute saved queries prior to the script""

◾ Enter the ID e.g. 26

◾ Click on Save

◾ In the Script Configuration Box the ID 26 is not displaying

◾ Click on ""Edit"" and the ID 26 is missing



When the part ""Publish output file"" is completely filled, you can save the ID 26 in the saved queries.



Actual: It is not possible to save the query ID with the activated checkbox ""Execute saved queries prior to the script"". 

Expected:  To save the query ID with the activated checkbox ""Execute saved queries prior to the script""."

Fixed the file extension check. To test create two script files with the endings "".xsl"" and "".XSL"" and save a configuration. After deleting the files the configuration has to been deleted, too."
