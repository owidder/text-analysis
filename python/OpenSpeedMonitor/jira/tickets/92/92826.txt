Test bundles and installers	"This subtask can be done in parallel by several people. Below you'll find possible parts. If you test or you are going to test a part, just write your short name to this part.



We need to test bundles (see https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/display/ITPL/Release-Prozess#Release-Prozess-3.2.1Bundles) and intstallers (see https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/display/ITPL/Release-Prozess#Release-Prozess-3.2.2Installer)



We test the *major functionalities*, i.e.

* Edit and save a Building Block

* Export and Import to/from excel (where possible)

* Open a diagram in the interactive client (where possible)

* Open a diagram in the classic client (not the Classic Nested Cluster Diagram)
