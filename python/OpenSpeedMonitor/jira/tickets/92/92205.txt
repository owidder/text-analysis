digital certificate invalid	"While reinstalling iteraplan.vss (very important for us for information flow diagrams - it allows to copy the layout of diagrams to new diagrams) to in Visio we got an error because of invalid digital signature which deactivates execution of macros.

Do you have a certificate we can use?"		Fault	iteraplan Support	02/Aug/16 10:00 AM	22/Aug/16 7:00 AM														"02/Aug/16 10:00 AM;ansgar.marsiske@coface.com;

we have no certificate for Visio 2007.
The notification window shows up, because of the security settings from Microsoft Visio 2007.

With following link, you found alle security options for Visio 2007 and set iteraplan as trusted side:
