No Notification when building block is created via Excel import	"Timebox; 1 

This ticket is related to ITERAPLAN-3930







_Reproduce:_

# Activate Notifications

# Subscribe to, for example, building block type Information Systems

# Create a new  Information Systems using Excel Import (via Mass Data)



_Expected:_ Notification E-Mail as when a Building Block is created using the GUI

_Actual:_ No Notification.



_Reason:_ Notifications are implemented using AOP, and the pointcuts to intercept building block creation use methods in FrontendServices. Those methods, however, are not used when creating new Building Blocks using REST. This is fixed in ITERAPLAN-3930.



For Excel import this doesn't work.



*To do:*

Change the pointcut for ""saveOrUpdate"" method in building block service to also handle ""created"" elements.

Decide whether an element is created or updated based on whether the building block given as parameter has an id (update) or not (create). Important: check this before the actual saveOrUpdate method is called.

Distinction between ""created"", ""new copy"" and ""new release"" is no longer necessary."

As agreed with [~sfe] this should be fixed in this ticket with suggested solution	"05/Jul/16 11:29 AM;sfe;The suggested solution does not work, since it is not possible to calculate actual changes of building blocks where the pointcut needs to be set for the import to trigger notifications.

Possible alternate solution, needs to be discussed:

* Implementation of a EmailModelBuilder based on the elastic diff object used during the import.

* Using that EmailModelBuilder to write notifications without AOP

* Difficulties:

** Elastic doesn't know about subscribed users. These would have to be determined extra, for example during the reloading of building blocks in {{MiIteraplanDiffWriter}}



Other possible alternative with reduced functionality:

Aggregated Email-Notifications from Imports. Just a list of names of changed elements or the like."	"05/Jul/16 12:49 PM;sfe;The actual issue could not be resolved here: see ITERAPLAN-4765 for follow-up.

There was however a refactoring done in this ticket which should be reviewed."	06/Jul/16 11:01 AM;sfe;The refactoring done in this ticket was reverted again, as it caused issues in tests run by the build server. As such, nothing happened in this ticket, and the described bug will be fixed in the follow-up ticket.	07/Jul/16 11:24 AM;sfe;Changeset [25530|https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/changelog/iteraplan?cs=25530] belongs to IPTT-17 and was accidentally committed with a wrong comment.
