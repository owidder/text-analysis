 LSD Click on y axis opens content tool area	"When an LSD has a y axis with 2 or more hierarchy levels,

the click on the y axis opens the tool area for the content area 

instead of the y axis area.



Suspected: background panel for the clicks to content is too large and too far left, overlapping the axis.
