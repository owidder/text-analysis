Seems to be related to the space between SAP and CO."		Bug	iteraplan PO	01/Dec/15 4:51 PM	12/Apr/16 2:07 PM					classic									31/Mar/16 1:18 PM;abo;Same issue for v 5.0.0 (SVN: tags/Release_5_0_0)	"04/Apr/16 9:55 AM;abo;Fixed by adding wildcards to the beginning and the end of the search-term. But not in between (e.g. ""Softw Sys"" will never find ""Software System"" but ""Softw Sysiphus"").



Documentation does not need an update, does it? 

(http://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan51/Finding)

"	"04/Apr/16 12:56 PM;gph;The desired behavior (according to [~fka]) is:



A search term should work like:

* the splitted (by whitespaces) parts

* with wildcards around them and

* combined with ""AND""



For example:

The term ""sap xyz fi"" (without quotes) should work like

\*sap\* AND \*xyz\* AND \*fi\*



Currently, the clauses inside the LuceneQuery object work like

\*sap AND xyz AND fi\*



The documentation should be adjusted accordingly.



Additionally, the documentation text should be cleaned from:

* Information about previous releases (""In previous versions ..:""). This is just confusing. Only the current state should be described in the documentation.

* Errors (like: ""But this also mean ..."")

* The hint, that the search works ""like Google"" and that ""words are not searched literally"" but ""similar words ... as well"". This is not true.
