"	65408	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	04/Dec/15 1:20 PM	29/Jan/16 11:11 AM														14/Jan/16 3:32 PM;msr;[~sfe]: UI Element should be done. Main focus in this ticket is how to handle different operators. Therefore refactor $scope.dialogFilterOperators in toolAreaController2.js, e.g. create a new class with own methods or at least outsource to a new file.	"25/Jan/16 10:01 AM;msr;Additional TODOs (ticket extension):

* Check, if operator-assignment to value-inputbox matches (e.g. ""is"" and ""is_not"" in enum-case)

* Check, if ng-model fits, e.g. for text not ""ng-model=""singleFilterHolder.singleFilterObject.value"""" but ""filterValues"""	"25/Jan/16 1:30 PM;msr;Additional TODOs (ticket extension):

* datepicker and rangeslider do not work: Create ""updateSingleFilter""-method in SingleFilterHolder, which creates borders for datepicker and rangeslider

* enum-literal-list does not work: Create ""updateSingleFilter""-method in SingleFilterHolder, which creates borders for datepicker and rangeslider

* (/) fields of SingleFilters (e.g. translationData) are not updated: Create ""updateOperator""-method in SingleFilterHolder to update translationData."	27/Jan/16 5:13 PM;msr;Still Open TODOs are now in scope of ITERAPLAN-3933. That's why, I finish this ticket	27/Jan/16 5:14 PM;msr;*Remaining effort for review: ca. 0.5 PD*	28/Jan/16 9:19 AM;sfe;Originally 1 PD
