Research alternate solution for long history table name problem, and fix problem	"Create/write a simple an manual test procedure to check if the table names are within the limit of Oracle, and execute the procedure.



Test question: are the table names for history tables short enough or too long?



a) OK even without patch (could be because of new Oracle dialect)

b) NOT OK, but OK with additional settings in Hibernate

c) NOT OK, no settings possible, -> patch needed.



If a), document and stop



if not OK, do some research on Hibernate/Oracle settings. 

Look for obvious and documented and supported settings/configurations only.

Everything that is not readily found by a specific search is probably NOT supported.



If there is a configuration, patch-free way, verify it by retesting, document it, stop.



If there is no config: split off relevant part of patch, apply it, retest, document, stop."	63118	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	03/Dec/15 8:10 AM	16/Dec/15 3:27 PM														14/Dec/15 9:49 AM;gph;Checked schema creation with and without patch class in versions from 2.8 to current with different database systems. Result: The table names are always the same. Could not reproduce the creation of long table names in any configuration. For the time being the formerly patched class "org.hibernate.envers.configuration.metadata.CollectionMetadataGenerator" will be left away => use the original implementation.

But actually this cannot be reproduced."
