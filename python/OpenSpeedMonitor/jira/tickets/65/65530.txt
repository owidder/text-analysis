Query Processor (shorten url)	"The queryProcessor uses a array of hard coded attributes, keys, ... (see common\queryAlias.js) to shorten the url. 



If you create a new attribute it wont be shortened, because it isnt in the array. 



Solution:

Maybe use the id of the attributes 

Transform the integer in a higher base? Like 62 -> 0 = 0, 1 = 1, a = 10, b = 11, A = 35, B = 36, ..., Z = 62
