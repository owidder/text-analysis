fix IFD coloring - add a new "undefined" category	"reproduction:

- open ifd and set coloring -> complexity



expected:

- coloring is applied



actual:

- nothing happens



idea:

seems like the diagram can't be drawn because of the case when a property is not set and therefore undefined



solution:

- we need a new category ""undefined"" just like in LSD

- -Use coloring code of LSD and generalize it to be used in all goJS diagrams. If this takes longer than the estimated 3 days, instead fix only IFD code.- => ITERAPLAN-4368



more concrete example:

- the information system called ""Claim & benefit mgmt assurance"" has an attribute -> complexity which is NOT ASSIGNED

- if ifd coloring complexity is applied, it is not possible to get a color for this IS

- this leads to an undefined value which is not handled correctly at the moment





when fixing this, remember to create a legend entry too"		Bug	iteraplan PO	07/Dec/15 11:06 AM	26/Feb/16 3:51 PM					Coloring	IFD								28/Jan/16 9:45 AM;sfe;Also activate the according protractor tests and make them green.
