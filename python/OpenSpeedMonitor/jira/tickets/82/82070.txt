Various filter issues	"Applies to the ""new"" filter in all diagrams in the interactive client



* (/) -Change ""Add filter"" text in tool area menu to ""Edit filter"". Equivalent change in German, too.-

* (/) When an already selected operater is changed (e.g. ""contains"" to ""contains not"") this has no immidiate effect. You have to change the value field to have the new operator in effect.

How it should be: When the operator is changed, the value field is clearad. The diagram changes to the state whithout the current filter in effect (the filter is not completely configured)

* (/) -When an already selected attribute is changed, this has no immidiate effect, the operator stays even if it is no longer avaiavle with the new attribute.-

-How it should be: Similar with operator change, clear operator and value, change the diagram.-"		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Apr/16 1:39 PM	28/Apr/16 12:10 PM														28/Apr/16 12:10 PM;mse;Filter works now as described.
