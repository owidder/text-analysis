Define how build information is handled	"Currently, it seems like the build information displayed is only taken from the constants.js (BUILD). This has several withdraws:

# it contains only a release number but no commit id

# it has to be updated manually before every release

# it is not possible to (automatically) display if the version used is a corporate edition, light edition etc.



Please clarify if we want to handle this in a different way."		Task	iteraplan PO	26/Apr/16 3:58 PM	31/Aug/16 4:28 PM
