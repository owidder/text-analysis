LSD. Wrong legend entries for date range filters	"* Open LSD

* Add new content filter for productive period.



-if no from-date is entered, user will see 'Productive period from *{color:red}5/1/2005{color}* to ...'-

if no to-date is entered, user will see 'Productive period from 5/1/2005 to *{color:red}NaN/NaN/NaN{color}*'"		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Apr/16 9:03 AM	26/Apr/16 1:36 PM														26/Apr/16 10:55 AM;msr;Agreed with [~tam] : First "if"-condition is not reproducable, as from-date has initially set the minimum value.	"26/Apr/16 1:36 PM;tam;Some notes: if there are items with no productive period end no default date will be added to 'to'-date field.



However it seems that 'from'-default-value will be computed different. If there are items with no productive period begin the minimum value will be shown.



Maybe it makes sense to handle these both cases equally"
