Filter operators are not translated into German	"* Open LSD.

* Change language to German.

* Add for example a content filter for Productive period.

The operators are not translated in German and are still in English: (e.g. between, arbitary value, no value)"		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Apr/16 9:18 AM	15/Jun/16 2:20 PM					filter									"11/May/16 1:30 PM;ach;rejected, caused by small bug:

reproduce: 

- keep english language

- set a single filter (e.g. with ""between"" operator)

- close dialog window

- change language to german

- open filter dialog window again 

- operator name is still in english."	11/May/16 1:45 PM;mwe;Translated the selected operator, too.	"12/May/16 5:17 PM;abo;Review-Comments:

* the change in {{SingleFilterRowController.prototype.operatorIsSelected()}} causes already configured filters to be reset when reopened.

** it works with the previous implementation, but still does not solve the other issue.

* translation does not work, too (as stated by [~ach]) when you create a filter, close the dialog, change the language and open the filter-dialog again.

** However, when you switch the language several times, this usecase is working / translation is done correctly with already set filters"	15/Jun/16 2:20 PM;abo;Created a follow-up ticket (ITERAPLAN-4720) and closed the issue, because translation is working for the common use-case: the user switches the language once on opening iteraplan.
