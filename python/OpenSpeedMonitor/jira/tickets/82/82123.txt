Change width of both diagrams	"*Summary:*

Create a mechanism to change the width of both diagrams (the table and the daterange-bars).



*As-Is:*

* No possibility to change the width of the diagrams



*To-Be:*

* The width of both diagrams can be changed



*Implementation Details:*

* Nothing is saved in the mpdConfiguration or Url or Legend

* Create two buttons under the right border to change the width. A button with a right arrow for wider and a button with a left arrow for narrower.



Mechanism for right diagram (= daterange-bar diagram):

* When you make the right diagram wider or narrower, only the right diagram becomes wider or narrower, i.e. its viewport is changed.

* The left diagram (=table) is not affected.

* The full width of the diagram is changed.



Mechanism for left diagram (= table):

* When you make the table wider or narrower, the table becomes wider or narrower AND the daterange-bars-diagram becomes narrower or wider (opposite direction).

* The right diagram (=daterange-bars diagram) is affected in the opposite direction.

* The full width of the diagram stays unchanged.



Change step = 50 pixels

Both diagrams should be always visible and cann't disappear



*UI:*

* Talk to [~wfr] or [~mwe] or [~msr] *before* starting this ticket.

Unit test of formula for sizes/widths might be good.

Thanks."	"15/Jun/16 2:47 PM;msr;The code is really good. I like it.
