BSH - No mail for subscribed elements	"BSH has configured mail server, mail adresses for iteraplan users and subscribed to elements. Yet, changing an element does not result in email received at subscribers. Subscriber and ""changer"" are different iteraplan users.



Current mail config in iteraplan.properties:

notification.activated=true

notification.email.from=MCW-ITERAPLAN-bshg1@bshg.com

notification.smtpserver=smtp.bshg.com

notification.port=25

notification.ssl.enable=false

notification.starttls.enable=false

(username and password are set as well)



Questions:

1) might the notification feature send ""dailies""? Yet, modification of single Information System happened yesterday and subscribers did not receive email today.

2) How to log if iteraplan sent notification email to subscribers? How to log error messages from mail server? Currently, logs do not show anything with regard to email.



Thanks

Unfortunately, we currently have only logging for errors during sending emails in place, but not to log each attempt at sending an email or to log successfully sent emails.

Quick question:
Has the intended recipient of the notifications subscribed to the changed element in question, or just to the building block type?"	"03/May/16 2:20 PM;bwu;Subscriber has subscribed to the single BBE .

Yet, problem was found, it was a typo in the mail server address provided to the iteraplan admin :(

Still strange that in the logs were no indications about unknown host or something like that."
