Service for text representation of different field types	"Do we already have some ability to get the textual representation of values for the different field types?

E.g., in the MPD diagram we can have additional columns of different types (duration, date, multiple fields, like Accountability and so on). For the GoJS diagram we should provide their textual representation. I believe, for the other diagram types we will need this too, and perform the same conversion in the code for each diagram will produce lots of duplicated code.

Probably, we already have this conversion implemented? If we do, how can I use it?



And another related question: we have a duration-type field. Do we already have the methods implemented to work with this type of field? E.g. getters/setters for start-end of the duration value."	82349	Sub-task	iteraplan Speedbird	28/Apr/16 12:07 PM	05/Jul/16 8:32 PM														"02/May/16 11:17 AM;msr;To tranlsate dates there exists already functions in utils.js:
