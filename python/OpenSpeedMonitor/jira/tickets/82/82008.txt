[~sfe] created a kind of fix for IE if diagram size is smaller than canvas size. In this case the partial diagram message will be shown and full diagram download is available.



In Firefox it seem to be a strange bug / feature occuring only for some users. After consultation with [~fka] we won't fix it because we are going to change diagram creation in the next releases.



Ps.

Just a note. The whole diagram will be shown if zoom out. Maybe a gojs bug?!"	27/Apr/16 11:09 AM;tam;Ticket for performance problems of the PDF-Download in Firefox ITERAPLAN-4332
