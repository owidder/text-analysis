Create Building-Block-Type-Selection for Level 1



*As-Is:*

* mpdController (transferAction)

* mpdLegendController

* mpdLegendMain

* mpdLegendBuilder

* mpdToolAreaViewModelBuilder

* mpdContentController

* mpdContentMain

* mpdDataService



*Implementation Details:*

* This is the first ticket with a need for a Tool Area.

* Therefore, the main tasks to do in this ticket is about the Tool Area.

* Ask [~mada] for the interaction between Tool Area and Controller and Configuration

* The user-set configuration should be used in the mpdDataService and in the legend.

* Use English terms also for the German localisation.



*UI:*

* Talk to [~msr] *before* starting this ticket

* Create a new Tool Area Main Entry called ""Content element type""

* Next level of the Tool Area (Drop-Down of Content element type) displays ""Level 1"", ""Level 2"" and ""Level 3""

* When you hover over ""Level 1"" all Building Block Types are shown in an alphabetical order. The actual selection is highlighted in bold.

* Information System is default value.

* Legend is created in ITERAPLAN-4522



*Acceptance Criteria:*

* The user opens a Masterplan Diagram.

* A default Masterplan Diagram is shown with Information System as Level 1

* The user clicks with primary click on any diagram element in the content.

* The Tool Area opens immediately

* The user hovers over ""Content element type"" in the Tool Area

* A Drop-Down opens immediately

* The user hovers over ""Level 1""

* Right of Level 1 an additional menu opens immediately which shows all Building Block Types

* Information System is highlighted in bold

* The user selects ""Projects""

* The Tool Area is closed immediately, the diagram is redrawn

* Projects are now shown as Level 1 elements, the legend is updated
