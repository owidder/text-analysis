* The download on the iteraplan-homepage is v5.1.0 (instead of 5.2.0). Please make v5.2 the default download!

** The according docker container shows a push a few days (~7) ago, but I can't see whether it means that it is serving v5.2 now. Please verify!

* I can't see a job specific for serving the online demo in v5.2 / and no job building the branch. Please check, whether these tasks are done in another Job!"	"20/May/16 11:16 AM;sfe;* Lite edition download on iteraplan homepage was updated

** The docker container is the responsibility of colleagues from Hamburg. Communication to get a status was initiated.

* Jobs specific to the online demo can be found here: https://iteraplan.iteratec.de/hudson/view/Demoserver%20Jobs/

With each release their SVN paths are updated so they build the latest release.

I am not sure what you mean with ""no job building the branch"". If you mean for building the release artifacts, there is a parametrized job that lets you select the branch on execution: https://iteraplan.iteratec.de/hudson/view/Release/job/BuildRelease/"	06/Jun/16 10:01 AM;abo;Review OK.
