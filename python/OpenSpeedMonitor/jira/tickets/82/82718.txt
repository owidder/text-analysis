NCD: Color picker can only change one color for enum attributes	"Reproduce:



# Color inner elements in NCD by a enum attribute (e.g. Complexity)

# Change one of teh default colors (e.g. the color for ""low"")

# Change another color (e.g. for ""medium"")



Expected: Both colors are changed



Result: Only the last change is applied (color for ""medium"" in the example above), while the color set in the step before is reset to the default value"		Bug	iteraplan PO	02/May/16 10:44 AM	13/May/16 12:44 PM														"11/May/16 11:30 AM;mse;* Defect fixed
