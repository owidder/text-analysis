Loading indicator for MPD	"*Summary:*

Implement a loading indicator for the Masterplan Diagram.



*As-Is:*

* No loading indicator exists.



*To-Be:*

* A loading indicator is shown during the diagram-redraw.



*Affected JS-Files:*

* mpdTemplate

* mpdController

* mpdContentController

* locales-de

* locales-en



*Implementation Details:*

* Use the IFD as blueprint.



*UI:*

* The localised term ""Loading diagram ..."" is shown on the top left side directly under the header (like in the IFD).



*Acceptance Criteria:*

*  The user opens the Masterplan Diagram.

* During the rendering of the diagram a localised term ""Loading term ..."" is shown on the top left directly under the header.

* As soon as the diagram appears, the term disappears.

/trunk/app/js/mpd/mpdContent/mpdContentController.js



{code:java}

	this.createGoJSDiagram = function () {

		var cont = getMpdCtrl();

		...

	};

{code}

	The variable name probably not that good?! Better would be ctrl?

	No need to store mpdCtrl in the variable



/trunk/tests/unit/mpd/mpdController-spec.js





{code:java}

	//$log = angular.mock.$log;

	$log = {

		warn: function () {

		}

	};

{code}



	do we need // $log or can it be removed?





{code:java}

	it('should setIsDrawing', function () {

		...

    

        // reset all the variables for another test

        $applyHasBeenCalled = false;

        $scope.isDrwaing = false;

    });



{code}

	

	Probably the wrong place for reset?

	Is it not better to reset in beforeEach?
