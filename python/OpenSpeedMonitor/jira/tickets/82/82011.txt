POST via REST API changes too many data	"Reproduce:



# Login as system user

# Download xslx file with metamodel and bank data

# Add 1 new IS to xlsx file

# Change 1 existing business mapping to include the new IS

# Sent a POST request via REST with the changed xlsx file (address something like: http://localhost:8080/iteraplan/api/data)



Result: 



* New IS is added

* Existing Business Mapping is changed



Expected (according to test specifications):



* New IS is added, but existing Business Mapping should *not* be changed"		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Apr/16 9:13 AM	26/Apr/16 9:25 AM														26/Apr/16 9:25 AM;sfe;There was a misunderstanding while testing this feature.
