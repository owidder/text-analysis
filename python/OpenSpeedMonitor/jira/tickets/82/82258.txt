Add color picker to N3CD			New Feature	iteraplan PO	27/Apr/16 3:12 PM	06/May/16 9:04 AM														"27/Apr/16 11:15 PM;msr;DONE:

* enumeration (incl. URL)

* ncdLegendBuilder for num



TO-DO:

* numeric coloring, i.e.

** start with: ncdController: $scope.applyColorPickerValue

** ncdConfiguration: save new colorvalue in the configurationParameters (and url)

** ncdItemDecorator: extend functionality, so it can work with individual max and min-colors and not with the hard-coded ones from 'coloringSchemes.js'



BUG:

* Colorpicker opens on any click on the legend and not only on the valid boxes

* URL is always ""one value behind"" for enumeration coloring with the colorpicker, e.g.

** Set the color for ""high"" first to blue, then to ""pink""

** Refresh the page with ""F5"" -> the color is blue (as the url was one value behind)"	27/Apr/16 11:16 PM;msr;Commit #2925 belongs to this ticket!
