Navigation from diagram to single element view	"As iteraplan user I want to be able to navigate from a diagram in the interactive client directly to the detail view of an element displayed in the diagram, to easily access detailed properties of building blocks of interest.



In the classic client this was solved by linking each diagram element to the corresponding single element view in iteraplan."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	03/May/16 3:19 PM	27/Mar/17 1:41 PM
