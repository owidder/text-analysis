POST without payload results in NullPointerException	"When I am logged in and POST to http://localhost:8080/iteraplan/api/data without adding any payload, then a NullPointerException occurs. This should be handled in another way! Additionally the client should not get any exceptions for security reasons.



Note: the request was created with the Firefox Plugin HttpRequester with the following steps:

# adding the URL

# tab Content to Send: ContentType = application/json (was preselected); RadioButton File but no file selected

# submitting the Request as POST"		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/Apr/16 12:35 PM
