The color picker is not working	"Timebox: 2



The color picker will be displayed if you click anywhere in the legend. I think the color picker should only be displayed if you have clicked on the element in the legend.



The color of the color picker can not be applied to the elements. There is no button or something like that."		Bug	iteraplan PO	22/Apr/16 12:45 PM	01/Jul/16 11:43 AM					lsd
