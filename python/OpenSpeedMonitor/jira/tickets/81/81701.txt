Excel Import via REST throws IllegalStateException	"When I have initialData and log in as system and I can export an excel spreadsheet of the data (which is empty). I add an InformationSystem (which is taken from a bank data export) and POST the edited excel file to api/data - see [^iteraplanExcelData_error.xlsx]



Expected result: InformationSystems are updated

Actual result: 505 and Exception:

{code}

java.lang.IllegalStateException: java.util.concurrent.ExecutionException: de.iteratec.iteraplan.elasticmi.exception.ElasticMiException: IteraQl model and data loading failed: 

de.iteratec.iteraplan.elasticmi.exception.ElasticMiException: java.lang.IllegalStateException: Cannot set 2 values on property with upper bound 1

{code}



This exception is forwarded to the REST Client which is (for security reasons) probably unwanted behaviour too!"		Bug	iteraplan PO	24/Apr/16 8:39 PM
