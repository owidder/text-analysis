Export/Import of data from iteraplan Community edition to Corporate edition	"Hi,



We contacted you by e-mail earlier, but confused the editions in our question. So I will give it a try here instead :)



We need to move all data from our current iteraplan installation (Community edition Build ID: Community Edition Build-v3.3.1-r23177) to our new Corporate edition installation of iteraplan (Build ID: Corporate Edition v5.1.0-r25160).



Is there an easy way to do this? Perhaps you have some script for this purpose? Or do we need to copy-paste all the data to the Excel spread sheet  to import it?



Thanks in advance!



Best Regards,

Sara Vickman

I can offer you to do a database migration from the HSQLDB database of your Community Edition to a MySQL database for you.
The result would still be a MySQL database for iteraplan version 3.3.1.
From there you can use the provided migration scripts to migrate to version 5.1.0.

Best regards,
Stephan Feroudj"	"22/Apr/16 1:06 PM;sara.vickman@dewire.com;Hi,

That would be great, thank you! Do you need the whole HSQLDB or just the data folder? Should I attach it directly in this request?

the data folder should be enough, and yes, please attach it directly here.
BR,
Stephan"	"25/Apr/16 1:58 PM;sara.vickman@dewire.com;See the attached data folder. Please let me know if you need anything else!

Do you have an idea of when I can expect the migrated data? I need to know in order to plan my work concerning this.

BR,
Sara"	29/Apr/16 4:02 PM;sfe;Hi, I'm sorry for the delay. I'll be able to provide the migrated data on Monday.	29/Apr/16 4:08 PM;sara.vickman@dewire.com;Thank you, that would be great!	"02/May/16 1:19 PM;sfe;I have attached a zip archive ([^dewire_migration.zip]) with two sql files:
* dewire_migration_331.sql - this is a MySQL dump of the data for iteraplan version 3.3.1
* dewire_migration_510.sql - this is a MySQL dump of the data already migrated to version 5.1.0. Please be aware that this data does not include a valid license key, which is necessary for iteraplan 5.1.0 to be usable.

Both files do not include the tables for iTURM. In a standard iteraplan installation with iTURM, the iTURM tables are usually in a different database schema, as opposed to the bundle version of iteraplan, where they are included in the iteraplan schema."	02/May/16 1:59 PM;sara.vickman@dewire.com;Ok, super. Thank you for your effort!
