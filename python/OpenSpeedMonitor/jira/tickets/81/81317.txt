Filter is not applied correctly when definition is updated	"Reproduce:



# Go to LSD

# Add content filter on a text attribute (e.g. ""Name contains Broker"")

# Close and reopen filter dialog

# Change ""contains"" in filter definition to ""contains not""



Result: the diagram doesn't change



Expected: Diagram and legend are updated to the new filter definition"		Bug	iteraplan PO	21/Apr/16 2:20 PM	26/Apr/16 4:51 PM
