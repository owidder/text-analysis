Fix e2e test setup and/or tests themselves	"Our e2e tests almost always fail, possibly due to some nondeterministic tests, possibly bad test setup.

Please investigate and solve this issue.

(for this see the linked tickets)



Also: find a way, if not too difficult, to execute e2e tests without unnecessary redeployments of the server component of iteraplan, to increase responsiveness and reduce strain on the build server."		Bug	iteraplan PO	21/Apr/16 11:10 AM	06/Jun/16 11:14 AM														"01/Jun/16 6:13 PM;sfe;I've created the jenkins job Deploy_client_for_e2e which deploys the client separately from the server to the test tomcat, and then executes e2e tests on that client.

The goal is to avoid redeploying the complete iteraplan application whenever there is a change in the client repository.

In exchange, the complete iteraplan-e2e test instance will be deployed whenever a change in the server repository is detected."	"06/Jun/16 11:13 AM;tam;Discussed ticket with [~sfe], deleted a jenkins job, which was disabled for this ticket.



Also discussed shortly follow-up tickets."
