Database copy and search index	"Hello,



At Electrabel, we have two iteraplan instance running at MCon: one for test and one for prod.

MCon created a Jenkins job that allows us to perform a dump of the MySQL database and an import in the test database.

It seems to work ok, all data are present.

Nevertheless full text search is not working. Queries are running ok but full test search does not return any result on applications, business functions, ...



Any idea why it could behave like this? Som re-indexing to perform after the import?



Thanks for your answer,

when changing the database content with external methods like in this example importing an MySQL dump, then there is indeed a search index which has to be recreated.

On the Administration->Configuration page in iteraplan you can find a button to rebuild the search index. I recommend also checking the checkbox to remove all old index entries.

Indeed it solves the issue. Thanks.
Can the reindexing be triggered externally by the jenkins job doing the database copy?

iteraplan does not provide support for automated or remote triggered reindexing.

The only possibility which comes to my mind is recording the request that's happening when the button is pressed. Then that request could be simulated with an according command line tool like ""curl"".
It is possible, however, that before that a login into iteraplan has to be done, or simulated in a similar way, to get hold of a session cookie to send with the reindexing request.
These things could be done by a jenkins job, once an according script exists. However, this is not a supported feature, as mentioned.
