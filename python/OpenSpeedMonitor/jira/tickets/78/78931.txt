Refactor GoJS diagram coloring	"Create the following functionality as diagram-independent code (preferrably by refactoring the coloring code of IFD or N3CD) and use it for all GoJS diagrams:

* Creation of a tool area entry for coloring, based on a metamodel type

* Creation of a palette object based on the selected property for coloring

* Display and configuration of the palette object in the diagram legend

* Calculation of a color/brush based on the palette object and property values"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	01/Apr/16 2:31 PM						coloring	GoJS								"15/Jul/16 6:53 AM;msr;[~fka]:

Actual staus:

* New coloring is fully implemented in the Masterplan Diagram

* In all other diagrams: Nested Cluster, Information Flow and Landscape this coloring still needs to be implemented"
