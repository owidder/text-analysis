Add distribution to IFD	"If necessary, change data service to take advantage of the different combined filter predicates, so items can be separated into ""fulfill all normal filters (without regard for level filter)"" and ""fulfill level filter"".



If an information system item ""A"" is not visible due to a level filter, but would be visible without the level filter, update the items corresponding to the descendants of the information system as follows:

* The descendant item is not visible -> no change

* The descendant item is visible, but is also descendant of another item which is a visible descendant of ""A"" -> no change

Example: ""B"" is visible descendant of (invisible) ""A"", ""C"" is visible descendant of ""B"" -> no change for ""C""

* The descendant item ""B"" is visible and there is no other visible descendant of ""A"" on the way from ""B"" to ""A"" along the parent relation:

** ""B"" gets all interface item references of ""A"" added

** All those interfaces have their connection information updated: For example, the interface item ""I"" no longer connects ""A"" to some other IS ""X"", but instead connects ""B"" to ""X"". Be aware that a single interface item may, in this way, connect several pairs of information system items.

Example: If ""A"" is connected to ""X"" via interface item ""I"", and has children ""B"" and ""C"", then after distribution, ""I"" will connect ""B"" and ""X"" as well as ""C"" and ""X"".



* During building of the GoJS graph, iterate over the connection pairs of each interface item, and create a separate edge for each of those pairs."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	29/Mar/16 9:49 AM
