Filter-Operator is not changed when changing the BB-Property	"Timebox: 0.5 days



GIVEN I opened the filter-dialog

AND selected a property (e.g. 'Costs' for Information Systems)

AND selected an operator (e.g. 'between')

AND set a value

WHEN I change the property (e.g. to 'Develpment Start')

THEN the value is no longer shown

BUT the previously selected operator ('between') remains selected



SHOULD: like for a newly created filter the operator is set to undefined
