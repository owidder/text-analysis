Add distribution to LSD	"* LSD already supports aggregation

* Aggregation works by moving coordinates of items that do not fulfill level requirements ""up"" to their next visible ancestor

* For Distribution, do the same, just downwards, and add an item's coordinates to its descendants under following conditions:

** The item itself is not displayed due to a level filter, but would be displayed without the level filter

** To have the original item's coordinates added, a descendent (of the original item) has to be visible, and there must not be another visible item on the way between the descendant and the original item."

* input data as well as the expected results are a large bunch of JSON data defined in the file. Please refactor that code to use a builder. That would reduce complexity and improve readability and changability in the future.

* Please rename _standardResult_ to _expectedResult_"	13/Apr/16 9:15 AM;mwe;Renamed _standardResult_ to _expectedResult_ and created a new ticket [ITERAPLAN-4452] to build a DataModelBuilder. There is not enough time to build it before the release (end of April)
