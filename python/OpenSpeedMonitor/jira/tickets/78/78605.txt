Add aggregation to IFD	"If necessary, change data service to take advantage of the different combined filter predicates, so items can be separated into ""fulfill all normal filters (without regard for level filter)"" and ""fulfill level filter"".



If an information system item ""Sub-A"" is not visible due to a level filter, but would be visible without the level filter, update the items corresponding to the ancestors of the information system as follows:

* The ancestor item is not visible -> no change

* The ancestor item is visible, but is also ancestor of another item which is a visible ancestor of ""A"" -> no change

Example: ""A"" is visible ancestor of (invisible) ""Sub-A"", ""Super-A"" is visible descendant of ""A"" -> no change for ""Super-A""

* The ancestor item ""A"" is visible and there is no other visible Ancestor of ""Sub-A"" on the way from ""Sub-A"" to ""A"" along the parent relation:

** ""A"" gets all interface item references of ""Sub-A"" added

** All those interfaces have their connection information updated: For example, the interface item ""I"" no longer connects ""Sub-A"" to some other IS ""X"", but instead connects ""A"" to ""X""."
