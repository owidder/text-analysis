Cleanup of (un)used libraries	"Timebox: 0,5



There are some libraries in the new client, which seem to be unused and probably can be removed from the project:

* jsPdf => can be removed when N3CD is ready

* canvas-toBlob

* ng-context-menu"		Task	iteraplan PO	23/Mar/16 10:50 AM	06/Jul/16 9:59 AM					newClient									29/Jun/16 5:37 PM;ach;review comment: remove unused libraries from nexus too	"30/Jun/16 10:10 AM;ach;after discussing with [~mwe] - don't remove libs from nexus. Just from Project dependencies

"	"05/Jul/16 9:25 AM;mse;*Review comments:*



* jsPdf ist still used in scgExportNCD.js (not sure if this file is still used, though...)

* Canvas-toBlob is not removed but still included in bower.jason (l. 29) and index.htm (l. 29)

* Please document which other libraries were removed. I found:

** angular-xeditable

** angular-animate

** date-parser"	"05/Jul/16 4:48 PM;pma;Notes to the libraries mentioned above: 

* canvas-toBlob is not removed because it is still used in the file headerDownloadService.js which is used in the controller of the diagrams.

* ng-context-menu was already deleted



In addition to jspdf, the following libraries have been removed:

* angular-xeditable

* angular-date-parser

* angular-animate



Furthermore following js-file was deleted: svgExportNCD.js because it used jspdf while this file itself is never used."	06/Jul/16 9:59 AM;mse;Review ok.
