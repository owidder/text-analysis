Problems to be expected due to oracle database upgrade?	We would like to upgrade our iteraplan oracle database from version 11.2.0.4 to version 12.1.0.2. Can we simply do this upgrade or are there problems to be expected?		Technical question	iteraplan Support	23/Mar/16 10:53 AM	18/Apr/16 2:44 PM														"24/Mar/16 9:39 AM;tam;Good morning.



Oracle 12c is only supported with the bug fix/patch No. 18430870 applied to the database. Without the patch iteraplan will not work correctly.



We recommend to apply all patches available for Oracle 12c.



Best regards,

With oracle 12c can we still use the Oracle JDBC 5 Connector or do we have to change to e.g. Oracle JDBC 7 Connector for Oracle Database 12.1.0.2?	31/Mar/16 10:50 AM;sfe;I recommend to use the Oracle JDBC 7 Connector for Oracle Database 12.1.0.2
