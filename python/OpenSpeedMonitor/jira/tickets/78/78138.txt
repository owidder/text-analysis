RangeSlider can't be changed after deserialization from URI	"WHEN I browse to a URI with a predefined filter that contains a range-slider (e.g. http://localhost:8080/client/#/lsd?locale=en&E24=A13&E25=B19&F0=B18&F19=Information%20Systems%20by%20Based%20on%20Technical%20Components%20and%20Assigned%20Information%20System%20Domains&partiallyConnectedItems=binary&rows=hide&columns=hide&contentFilter=numS%2FCostsS%2FbetweenS%2F896;3625C%2FflatC%2F)

AND I click on ""Content Filter"" > ""add new filter""

THEN the filter gets deserialized from the URI-part correctly

BUT I _can not_ change the values of the range-slider



SHOULD: I _can_ change the values of the range-slider
