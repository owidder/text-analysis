Replace metamodel mock with metamodel creator	"Currently, there is a mock metamodel to conveniently create metamodel mock types with properties and relationships, for tests.



Better would be to have a helper class that enables the creation of a real metamodel with similar convenience.

This is to both reduce maintenance effort when metamodel elements are changed as well as to remove the possibility of tests wrongly showing ""green"" just because the metamodel mock does not represent the productive code well enough.



Create a convenient builder for a metamodel json representation that can then be fed into the normal metamodel constructor. (/)



Also adjusts all tests which presently use the mock metamodel to instead use the metamodel builder. If for some reason this is not easily possible, discuss with [~sfe]."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	21/Mar/16 10:54 AM						test
