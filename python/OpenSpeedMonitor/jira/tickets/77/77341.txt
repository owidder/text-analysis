Add possibility to cancel an import	"As iteraplan user I want to be able to cancel an Excel import during the last import step.

That last step usually takes quite some time and it should be possible to cancel it, disregarding all work done up to that point, if I notice too late to have uploaded a wrong file, or for any other reason.



Solution principle:

* Allow cancel button to be active during last import step

* When activating the cancel button, a confirmation dialog appears

* When cancellation is confirmed, the import process is stopped and the transaction rolled back"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	17/Mar/16 1:12 PM						cancel	import
