ifdToolAreaViewModelBuilder: 

* Does ""computeStyleForToolAreaItem"" have to be public? Or is private enough?

* getLineType: return-Type is wrong: selectedLevel1Index, selectedIndex is missing

* Comment 359 is wrong

* getAllAttributesTypeEnum: JSDoc: public and function is missing

* getAllAttributesTypeEnum: JSDoc: the type of ""type"" is missing

* getDepth2ItemsForEnum: JSDoc: private and method is missing

* lineTypeEntryClick: JSDoc: Object is too generic

* updateSelectHighlighting: Does this have to be public or is private enough?
