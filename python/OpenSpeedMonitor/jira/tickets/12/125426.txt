SEARCH Tab: more space beneath content	"Go to the Search-Tab and search e.g. ""management"". The results are shown. 

 Now there is no space between ""recently accessed saved queries"" and the bottom border of the browser window.

 Better practice: Have a look at the borders in the other tabs. Even if you have to scroll down to see all data tiles, there is some free space towards the bottom.



TODO: Put empty space between the ""recently accessed..."" and the bottom border of the browser window. The height of this border should be equal to the other tabs.



And please remove the dots in the text ""You have no subscribed elements"" (respectively in German)."		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	26/Jun/17 12:33 PM	21/Jul/17 10:21 AM					GUI									21/Jul/17 10:21 AM;mash;Review is done
