Visio output format	"For all visualisations: Provide Visio as additional output format when downloading. Use the ""new"" XML-Visio format!



Realize within the backend as SVG to Visio conversion service.



The service only has to convert shapes and featuresÂ which are part of our diagrams. Depending on the effort necessary, some small shapes/features may be left out in the conversion. A 95% solution is sufficent.



Use the experience gained from a protoype built by one of the interns. Talk to WFR regarding this prototype. The prototype is good when it comes to conversion of single elements from SVG to Visio, the overall strcture of the resulting Visio file and certain algorithms, e.g. recognization of connecting edges in the info flow diagram. The overall code structure / quality in the prototype is less relevant ... ;)



1. SVG -> abstract format (done by using batik-framework)

2. abstract format -> Visio-format (to be done) [5 Storypoints]

3. Adjust SVG-shapes to Visio-shapes, e.g. change coordination system (to be done) [5 Storypoints]"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	11/Jun/17 1:17 PM															"10/Jul/17 2:42 PM;msr;[~mada]: I found the following references for the file format:
