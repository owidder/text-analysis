Multimode is not responding correctly	"Reproduce:



Go to the single element view of the information Systems.



Open the multi mode and prepend something to the name.



Expected behaviour: After this was successful a window opens that says how many elements where changed an the list is updated.



Current behaviour: No window opens and the list is not updated, only after a reload the values are changed
