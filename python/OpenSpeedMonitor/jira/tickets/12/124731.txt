Masterplan diagram is displayed incorrectly on minimum scale	"Steps to reproduce:

1) Open Masterplan diagram

2) Zoom timespan part to 5%



Actual result: size of timespan and timespan header is inconsistent (see screenshot)

Expected result: sizes of timespan and timespan header are equal and synchronized



Tested in IE11



-{color:red}UPDATE: {color} Please set the minimum zoom factor to 15% to solve this issue.-



{color:red}UPDATE: {color} Stop zooming when Timespan header diagram becomes narrower than available viewport for it (can get it from timespan diagram from the bottom). So no empty space will appear."		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	19/Jun/17 12:58 PM															"30/Jun/17 10:55 AM;dmkh;[~msr], [~mada], unfortunately, lowering minimum zoom level is not enough. The issue is still reproduced for Projects with Lifetime period (see screenshot).



I suggest stop zooming dynamically, when header timespan diagram is narrower then timespan diagram. It is the easiest solution for me and more flexible then lower zoom limit."
