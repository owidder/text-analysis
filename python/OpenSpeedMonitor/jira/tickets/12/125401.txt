Permanentely remove the iteraplan Classic Client	"Consider the following:

 * Also remove all now unneeded libraries. Update the 3rd party library overview and the list of used open source licenses.

 * Also remove the audit logging function, see here: [https://doc.iteraplan.de/display/iteraplan55/Other+Configuration+Options+and+Notes]

 * Don't forget to remove the template directory and functionality.

 * The saved query migration page will stay for now, it will be removed some time later. The migration functionality should therefore stay. Strip the migration page from header  (menu) and maybe add a (new) ""Back to iteraplan"" button, which links to the iteraplan Interactive Client Saved Query page.

 * Add comments to code that cannot be deleted because it is used in the saved query migration, when it can be deleted after the saved query migration is removed.

 * Remove the time series functionality completely, but keep the DB data tables

 * Remove the object related permissions completely, including DB tables/entries. Put it in a prominent place in the release notes!"
