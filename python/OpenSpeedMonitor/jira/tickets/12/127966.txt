Current Reactor Status => Console in Graphics Reactor	"*Summary:* Go to Report > Graphics Reactor. The ""Current Reactor Status"" container should look a little more like a console.



*Use Graphics Reactor:* Download the publicDemo_htmlTable.xsl and upload it to a folder. You can execute it by right-mouse-click. The logs of the console are written in ""Current Reactor Status"".



*ToDo:*

*See ppt mockup Console-new*

 # Â The Console goes beneath the folders-field. 

 # It has the same width as folders-div. The rest of the formatting of the container stays the same.

 # The header is ENG: ""Console""/ GER: ""Konsole""

 # Insert a gray container for the Console-output. The background of the this inner container has the colour: #f2f2f2.

 # Please use some typewriter/serif font like courier in this inner container.

 # The buttons ""Clear log"" and ""Export"" should become *default buttons* (Please use the same style as the buttons in List View. Or see default buttons: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/display/ITPL/UI-UX+Styleguide)

 # The ""Edit"" Button in the container ""Script Configuration"" should be a default button, too."		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	25/Jul/17 4:09 PM						UI
