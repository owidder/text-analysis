Legend is overlapping diagram	"Summary:

After user changes diagram configuration diagram is resized and is overlapped by previously opened legend.



Steps to reproduce:

1) Open default Masterplan diagram

2) Open legend (diagram is resized so now legend is not overlapping the diagram)

3) Change Content type to Project



Actual result: content type is changed, diagram is resized to full width of window, legend is overlapping the diagram

Expected result: content type is changed, diagram width stays, legend still is not overlapping the diagram (same applies to all config changes)"		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	19/Jun/17 1:30 PM	29/Jun/17 2:57 PM
