Dashboard container horizontal scrollbar missing	"Steps:

 # Open Custom Dashboard.

 # Add some diagram.

 # Put some width value big enough so Rendering container is wider that page.



Actual:



Rendered container has horizontal scroll bar missing. Instead, whole page has this scroll bar. (Screenshot attached)



Expected:



Rendered container has a scroll bar, not a whole page."
