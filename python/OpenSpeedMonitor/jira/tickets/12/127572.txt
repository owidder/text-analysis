Graphics Reactor: unfold, re-fold the folders	"*Scenario1:* 

 The User has created several new folders in the root folder. He unfolds (opens) folder1, by clicking on it in the left column. --> the content-files are shown in the right column and the underfolders (folders2 and 3) are shown in the left column.



*Expectation:* 

 By clicking on folder1 again, it folds back together and only the root folder and folder1 are displayed.



*Currently:* 

 Clicking on the folder1 when it's open, has no effect. The user can close folder1 by clicking on the parent-folder.



*ToDo:* 

 Change the functionality such that a folder that is open (where the arrow points downwards) can be closed by clicking on that folder again.



*Scenario2*: 

 The user has the folder-structure as in steffi3_open.png. He has opened steffi3. He clicks on ""steffis specific folder"" --> the arrow before steffi3 ""closes"" (points to the right) but the underfolder steffi4 is still shown in the structure (see screenshot ""steffis specific folder_open.png"").



*ToDo:*

 Leave the arrow of steffi3 pointing downwards when the user changes folders on the same hierarchy level.



*If these are possible features in the library please change them. If the library does not have the feature, we'll leave it as it is.*"		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	19/Jul/17 3:59 PM
