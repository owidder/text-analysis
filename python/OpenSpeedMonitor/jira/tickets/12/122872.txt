Subscription mails: Exception for newly assigned relations	"Use Case:

 * open single element view (e.g. businuess object Account)

 * add self relation, e.g. Balance as Specialized Budiness Object""



Result:

 * an exception appears in the iteraplan log



Cause:

 * the mail template requires does not match the existing change object



Furthermore: when removing the self-relation to Balance, the subscrition mail only contains an information about a change, not the details about what was changed."		Bug	iteraplan PO	30/May/17 5:23 PM
