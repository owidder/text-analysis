"this.toolAreaCtrl is null" on diagram reload	"h1. Strict timebox: 1.5 hours to find out, what is going on. If not possible, close this ticket



1. Open any diagram (I was able to reproduce with NCD, LSD in Firefox).



2. Refresh the page by pressing F5



Sometimes diagram is not loaded and there's error in console. Second refresh usually loads diagram well.
