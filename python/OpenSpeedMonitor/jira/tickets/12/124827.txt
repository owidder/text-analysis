 "		Bug	iteraplan PO	20/Jun/17 11:40 AM	21/Jun/17 9:14 AM														"20/Jun/17 1:27 PM;vadm;The ""Reset view"" button was removed from {color:#d04437}history{color} list header.

 Style of ""Reset view"" button in common header was adjusted according to new style guide."	20/Jun/17 2:01 PM;roia;[~msr], so, at the moment our lists should not have any "Reset View" functionality? "Reset view" is possible only for the whole pages? If it's true, then this task can be closed.	20/Jun/17 2:11 PM;aan;My idea was to remove it only for the list with the history entries, as its not properly working there anyway (an the only thing to be resetted there is the search anyway).	20/Jun/17 3:58 PM;roia;My idea is that we may need the "reset view" for some separate list if we have multiple lists on one page and the question is about this.	21/Jun/17 9:14 AM;msr;The implemented behaviour is ok. I'll close this ticket.
