Analyse Performance of Filter Application in IE11	"*Summary:*

Analyse the performance of Filter Application in IE11 for a list of 3000 elements



*Details:*

* Follow-up of IPTS-717

* Create a list of 3000 elements or take a big database to reproduce

* In IE11 it takes about 5 minutes to apply any filter clause (which is done automatically after each click), in firefox and chrome about 3-8 seconds

* Analyse why there is such a big difference

* Try to optimise this code for IE11 so the performance is similar to Chrome and Firefox

* Alternative: If this is not possible to improve the performance: Ensure that the filter are only applied at the end when closing the filter dialog *only in IE11*
