LIST-VIEW UI:  function "change width of column"	"When you hover over the gap between two column-headers you can adjust the width of the columns.

 The column-resize-icon is too dark, it should be white on the black background. 

 The space in which the hover-function works should be a little wider.



ToDo:

 1. Please use a white icon instead of the black one. (app.css ""cursor: col-resize"" ) --> colour of icon: white, borders: black, background: transparent

 2. Make the ""reactive"" area for column-resize a little wider. The action should be available in the green area marked in the screenshot FutureActiveArea.png in the attachment. --> bigger gaps (add 2-3px)"		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	26/Jun/17 11:58 AM	21/Jul/17 10:29 AM					usability									20/Jul/17 1:02 PM;dmkh;[~sbu], please, provide an image for resizing cursor (.cur is preferable because it is the only one supported in IE). I created a dummy one in Paint, but its quality is not perfect (see attached GIF).	"20/Jul/17 2:03 PM;sbu;[~dmkh], I'll attach one tomorrow, okay?

 # Do you only need the white shape on transparent background? Is the black border added automatically or should i add that to the .cur?

 # Should I use a certain size? Or just somewhere between 1x1 and 256x256px?"	20/Jul/17 2:21 PM;dmkh;[~sbu], we agreed with Marcel that we'll use custom resizing cursor only in Chrome and FF. So PNG could be added (32x32px, white shape with black border). Thanks.	20/Jul/17 2:49 PM;sbu;Perfect (y)	21/Jul/17 8:16 AM;sbu;Hi [~dmkh], I added the png. Is that okay? Do you also need it as .cur? It's no big deal to convert it (i think).	21/Jul/17 8:36 AM;dmkh;Hi, [~sbu], it is okay and looks perfect :). PNG is enough.
