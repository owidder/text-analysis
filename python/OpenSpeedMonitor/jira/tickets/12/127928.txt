Delete datetime	For all date columns in the differents lists of iteraplan, the propertytype "date_time" was used. The date column for the history table is the only column which uses the propertytype "datetime", see https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/changelog/iteraplan-9?cs=5217 (historySectionGrid-configuration.js). The two propertytypes have no difference in their representation. They mainly difference in their sorting as date_time sorts via strings and datetime via moment objects, which was fixed here for the history case https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/jira/browse/IPTS-767. Please fix this for the other cases as well and delete the propertytype "date_time".		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/Jul/17 10:39 AM
