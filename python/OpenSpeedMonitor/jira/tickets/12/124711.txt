Mass Update drop selection when user select filter option	"# Open 'Data' - 'Business Domain'.

 # Open Mass-Update(MULTI-MODE). All rows are selected.

 # Open 'Filter' and select 'Name'

 # All selection dropped.



{color:red}UPDATE: {color} The expected result is that the selection (all or no or a subset of elements selected) before the filter was opened remains unchanged."		Bug	iteraplan PO	19/Jun/17 10:52 AM	21/Jun/17 9:29 AM														19/Jun/17 3:00 PM;aan;Right now when opening the filter all elements are choosen, even when nothing was choosen before. I just talked to [~msr] about the expected behaviour and he clarified how it should be. Please adapt the behaviour accordingly.	19/Jun/17 6:29 PM;mash;There is 1 comments here: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-704#general-comments	20/Jun/17 10:57 AM;olal;This issue related to Filter behaviour at whole. For resolving it need to refactor Filter, which isn't urgent now. I created ticket ITERAPLAN-5426 for this issue.	21/Jun/17 9:29 AM;msr;Behaviour as expected
