Move methods out of constructor, body event listeners	"h2. Part #1:



At the moment ipList-component.js has about 2500 lines of code. All component methods are defined in the constructor and, therefore, are redefined each time the component instance is created.



E.g.

{code:java}

function IpListController (...) {

    ...

    this.deleteColumn = function (field) {

        ...

    }

}

{code}

should be rewritten to

{code:java}

function IpListController (...) {

    ...

}



IpListController.prototype.deleteColumn = function (field) {

    ...

}

{code}

This way methods will not be redefined each time.

h2. Part #2:



In the component we add a listener to document body:

{code:java}

document.body.addEventListener('dragover', onDragScroll, false)

{code}

First check if event is attached not more than one time. _- yes, it's attached multiple times (= number of rows in grid)_

 Then make sure that it does not remain attached after component gets destroyed. _- it was not destroyed. now it is._"		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	04/Jul/17 9:31 AM	24/Jul/17 1:36 PM														24/Jul/17 1:36 PM;olal;Review is done.
