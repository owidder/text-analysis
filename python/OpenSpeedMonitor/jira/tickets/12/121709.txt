SEV: No generalisation possible when already one is choosen	"Like with parents each BO can only have on generalisation. Therfore it should not be possible to add a generalisation to a BO (the type, not the synonym of BBT) that already has a generalisation.



The functionality is already implemented for parents, so implement the generalisation equivalent.



Keep in mind that there are the addRelation/updateRelation function and the function for adding changes from the backend that also have to update this variable (besides the initialisation).



*User story:*



The user is in the SEV of a BO, for example Account.



In the add relation dropdown chooses ""Contract"". The he chooses ""Specialised Business Object"". This relation is added to the view.



Now when chooses to add the BO ""Customer"" the option ""Specialised Business Object"" is inactive and he knows that this cannot be added as there is already such a connection.



When the relation to ""Contract"" is deleted the option has to be active again when choosing ""Customer"" and when choosing ""Contract""."		Improvement	iteraplan Thunderduck	18/May/17 8:13 AM	29/May/17 8:53 AM
