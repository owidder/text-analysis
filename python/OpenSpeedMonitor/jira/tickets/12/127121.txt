No text in header for same self-relation columns added fof multiple levels	"*Steps to reproduce:*

1) Open default MPD

2) Add Project as 2 level

3) Add Superordinate Information System column

4) Add Superordinate project column



*Actual result:*

No text for Superordinate project column.



*Expected result:*

Text in header is visible for all added additional columns.



Looks like it is reproduced for all common attributes and self-relations (with same persistentNames), but which have different translations. E.g. same reproduced for Lifetime period column (Project) and Dev. Interval column (IS) - persistentName is runtimePeriod.

Probably refactoring of mpdTableModel.js is needed for this case"		Bug	iteraplan PO	14/Jul/17 11:58 AM
