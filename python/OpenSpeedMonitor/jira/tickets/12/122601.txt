Implement attribute group permission dialog	"For each attribute group there should be a dialog to set the role permissions for this group.



The current person icon should bring up this pop up dialog, The dialog should have 3 columns: 

 # View

 # Edit

 # Role



For both the first and second column ""select all"" & ""select none"" should be available. Also provide a quick search (top right corner) which will search within the third column. ""Select all"" / ""select none"" will only apply to the visible entries (quicksearch will reduce them).



For each role: View is necessary to be checked to check edit. Cf. the bottom of the role page



Cancel & Ok button at the bottom right.



Layout might be similiar to the manual selection tab of the general filter dialog. SBU to deliver the detailed layout."
