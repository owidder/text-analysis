Exception getting Business Mapping history (server)	"*Steps to reproduce:*

 Lists -> Business Mapping



*Current result:*Â 



Server error message appears (see screenshots).



*Expected result:*



Business Mapping list is loaded correctly, business mapping history is available



Comments:

 After short investigation I've probably found a reason: incorrect hibernate mapping template for Business mapping (see screenshots). Business mapping history is available in the DB."
