"21/Jul/17 9:23 AM;aan;I created a new ticket for removing the old client completely after the saved query migration is also removed: ITERAPLAN-5528.



In this ticket a lot of folders and files are already deleted, but some had to be kept for the saved query migration. The idea behind removing the old client is, that we do not want to adapt code for the MMX that will be removed anyway. So if no adaptions are need this can be deferred."	24/Jul/17 8:23 AM;aan;The templates should be deleted when deleting the code so this does not lead to test failures.
