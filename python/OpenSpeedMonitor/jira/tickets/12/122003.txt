Demo Adminstration - UI and Feedback	"I have tested on the last week the new GUI of our Demo Administration. 

 Following points are not work correctly at the moment: 

 * When you delete a demo the will now be undeployed, but the database entries stays 

 * The **headers of the columns dont scroll with the horizontal scrollbar 

 * The checkbox must be above the registration button 

 * !image-2017-05-22-10-00-55-176.png!

 * Please change the symbol for savin a changed date. At the moment there is a pencil and not a save symbol 

 * Additional when a demo expired, it will not be remove completly (Database entry stays and will be shown in the ui)
