Resizing columns	When some column is resized, the correctWidthOfLastColumn() method calls in setColumnWidth(). In this case, it's not work correctly and produce bug https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/jira/browse/ITERAPLAN-5448 . Also it allow to resize other columns which are not in the last position, for minimum width, ignoring default settings. Would be better to replace using correctWidthOfLastColumn for other new method.	111840	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	03/Jul/17 9:54 AM
