*REST-API:*

* PUT the custom favicon to the database

* The reset button sends a DELETE which deletes the custom favicon from the database and publishes the default iteraplan favicon to the hardcoded url



*Database:*

* Two rows: One for the default iteraplan favicon (mandatory) and one for the custom favicon (optional)  - backend developer should decide if the default iteraplan favicon should be saved in the filesystem (current solution) or in the database (possible new solution?)
