Animation of Start Menu is lost	"*Summary*: The animation in the start menu of tiles ""flying"" in and out when changing tabs is gone.



*Reproduce*: Change from one tab to another on the Start-page. Have a look at nightly build versus [public demo|[https://demo.iteraplan.de/iteraplan_ee_release/client/#/home]]



*Actual*: In the nightly build there is no animation. 



*Expected:* There should be an animation of the tiles, flying in and out of the screen, when one changes tabs. Public Demo shows the right behaviour."		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	21/Jul/17 8:36 AM
