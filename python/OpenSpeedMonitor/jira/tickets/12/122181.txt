Subscription - Remove link to deleted element	"When I delete a e.g. Information System a mail will be created with a link to the deleted element. That makes in this context no sense, because when you click the link, a stacktrace in the console will be shown and that the element is not longer available. 



Just remove the link in the email for this case.
