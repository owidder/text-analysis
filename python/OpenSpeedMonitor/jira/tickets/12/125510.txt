Global Search and additional columns	"One of our customers want the option to add columns for the global search. 



In his example he searches for e.g. ""SAP"" and want add the column ""responsible"" for the search result. 



Now he can see all results for SAP and the associated ""responsible"".

1. The user searchs for ""SAP""

2. Then he takes over the result set to the Building Block List and can add any column there.
