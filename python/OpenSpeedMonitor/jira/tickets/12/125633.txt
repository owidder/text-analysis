Design a solution for the import of the bank data	"Find a solution for the import of Demo data and the other data we currently import via XMI.



Ideas up to now:



Use SQL statements if possible (check if Blob or Clob are needed in the data, then SQL is not working), if this is not possible use JSON.



For JSON add a data mapper,or check if there is already something to map JSON to the DB. SQL is probably easier.



CLOBs are used in:

 * user_settings

 * timeseries

 * saved queries (not in stored queries)

 * dashb_templ

 * application_settings

Talked to [~msr] about the tables containing CLOBs and if they are needed for the import.



Result: These tables are not necessary"		New Feature	iteraplan Thunderduck	28/Jun/17 11:24 AM															"06/Jul/17 9:48 AM;tsc;Key question is: Why do we want to retire the XMI import?



Requirements were:

1. use defined object ids (for usage in saved queries)

2. enable additional entities for import (e.g. saved queries in the interactive client)



Both requirements can be achieved with the XMI import:

1. the current xmi data files already contain object ids

2. the xmi import can be extended for addtional entities (tested with application settings)



Some advantages of the XMI Import:

- xmi files can be exported from an existing iteraplan database

- the xmi import is independent from any special database (a must requirement for the import)"
