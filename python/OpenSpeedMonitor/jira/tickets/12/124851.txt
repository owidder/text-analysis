Creating new building block without permission should not be possible	"One big bug and small one:



*Big Bug:*



Steps:

 # Disable CREATE permission for some BB type.

 # Access some single element view page of this type.

 # Press button from new element.

 # Press CREATE



Actual:



Element is created and user is redirected to single view of a new element.



Expected:



It is not possible to create new element. Creation dialog should not be opened.



Instead error message should be shown the same as when trying to create new element from list view.



*Small Bug:*



Steps: 

 # Disable CREATE permission for some BB type.

 # Access some single element view page of this type. (The same applies to copy in list)

 # Click on copy icon.

 # Click copy.



Actual:



Nothing happens. Error in console



Expected:



Add warning message the same when creating new element in list."		Bug	iteraplan PO	20/Jun/17 3:57 PM															21/Jun/17 10:27 AM;vadm;Review is done https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-719
