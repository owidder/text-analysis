SEV: position and style of the buttons	"In Single Element View: The five buttons ""new, copy, delete, diagram, show in navigator"" should be placed next to reset in the first row.



They should become default buttons (new, copy, delete default-wthout-text buttons). (see Style guide: [https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/display/ITPL/Buttons])



The button ""Show in Navigator"" . Please add the Icon that is also used in the List View ind Actions-column.



ToDo:

 # all Buttons into first row. Following order: reset, new-copy-delete, diagram, navigator, Subscription

subscription stays right-aligned and the others float left

 # Buttons *new copy delete* should have Default-Button-style without text (see save buttons on List-View)

 # *Diagram-* button: see List View, use the same icon and dropdown-arrow and upper case letters

 # *Navigator* should only be called eng: ""NAVIGATOR"" ger: ""NAVIGATOR"" (upper case letters) and gets the gps-icon"		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	06/Jul/17 3:00 PM	24/Jul/17 10:27 AM														21/Jul/17 9:57 AM;dmkh;Review is done, few comments here:Â https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-790
