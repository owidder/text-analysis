For missing BBT-permission: BBT is missing on attribute creation process	"*Summary:*

If you miss the read permission for a Building Block Type, this Building Block Type cannot be selected during the creation process of a new attribute.



*Reproduce:*

* Login with a user of a role which does *not* have the read-permission for Business Domain, but the permission to create an attribute

* Navigate to Administration\attributes

* Click on ""Create Element"" and ""Text Attribute""

* Click on ""Activated for the following Building Block Types""



*Actual:*

* Business Domain does not exist in this list



*Expected:*

* Business Domain is part of this list



*Solution idea:*

* Create a new (hidden? / at least not officially documented) REST API which sends the full localised metamodel to the new client"		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	12/Jun/17 1:53 PM	04/Jul/17 5:19 PM														04/Jul/17 5:19 PM;mash;Review is done
