Breadcrumbs show name of saved visualization	"In all visalizations: When user saves the configuration, the given name appears somewhere between the buttons at the top.Â 

 # Erase the name between the buttons

 # Insert the name in the breadcrumbs in the following style (see also example in attachment). The name is not cklickable



{code:java}

<Visualisation-Name>/<Name of saved configuration>{code}

The name of the current configuration stays in the breadcrumbs until user cklicks ""RESET"" - or another saved configuration is loaded, then it's replaced."
