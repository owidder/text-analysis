Change UI of Toolbar in all Diagrams	"The header in all diagram-views should be adjusted according to the [style guide|https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/display/ITPL/Diagram-Toolbar] 



The main changes in short are:

 # change font-size/weight --> equal to the buttons ""Save As"" etc.

 # The toolarea-backbround becomes white over the entire window-width

 # the buttons with text all have the same size (but react flexibly to changing window-size)

 # If there is enough time before R 6.0: What happens if the window is too small for tool-area?

 --> now: buttons are flipped to second row one by one 

 -->should be: buttons are divided in two groups, the first 3 (or 4) buttons and the last 3 (or four) buttons. the last group is flipped into second row together. 



For exact values and a first Mockup, please have a look at the style guide."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	06/Jun/17 2:51 PM	19/Jun/17 3:53 PM														"19/Jun/17 9:59 AM;sbu;Hi [~olal],



the new toolbar looks good. I just noticed, that the white area does not start right beneath the hline. There ist some gray space at the moment. Could you close this gap between the header (with iteraplan-logo) and the toolarea? 



Just fill the gap it with white and keep the buttons in their current position. Is that possible?
