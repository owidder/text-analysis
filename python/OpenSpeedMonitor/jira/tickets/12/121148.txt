Work on view in new client	"Replace the text field for the saved queries by a multi select input field with all saved queries.



Show the names of saved queries of the lists.



Be aware that the order of saved queries is relevant, hence the user needs a possibility to change it and the values should be shown in the order in which they are saved.



User story:



The user is on the graphics reactor page and editing and the configuration of an file that can be executed. Therefore he uploaded the file and choose it by clicking on it.



At the top of the alert he has checked ""Executing saved queries prior to the script"". When he clicks on the input field he can add addition is from an dropdown these are added at the back of the field with all the names.



Additionaly he can change the order of the ids via drag and drop. (or by using the arrow keys, in case this is much easier)



The configuration is save by using the ""save""-button."

But, when implementing this again please check at first if mdChips is implementing the drag and drop functionality that is planned at the moment and use it if it is there.	18/May/17 7:58 AM;aan;Please check with [~ip.fabian.kainzinger] if using names in the dropdown is ok. (The uuids are not shown to the user so the name seems to be the best way to identify them in the view)
