you can change the passwords for the users with iturm. 
He can create directly a ticket on this service desk, or I will write him a mail.

Could you please explain me how to reset his password without having access to the Iteraplan instance as Administrator?

The only way I see is directly in the database.

We would like to do also the Administrator user, we cannot find any access for this instance.

Thanks"	"17/Jul/17 12:38 PM;cst;Hi,

here are the steps to change the password on the database. 
 # open the database tables from ""iturm"".
 # We need the table ""im_user""
 # Here search for the user which you want to change 
 # Update the password to the following value ""5F4DCC3B5AA765D61D8327DEB882CF99"" 
 # After that, you can login with the username and the password ""password""
