2. In the attribute tab, change any of the attribute values. Switch to the history tab.



Currently: History does not show the atrribute change. You need to press reset view or F5.



Should be: History should display the changed attribute."		Bug	iteraplan PO	05/Jun/17 5:45 PM	16/Jun/17 5:29 PM														"12/Jun/17 10:26 AM;roia;The issue #1 is not reproducible. Tried in IE-10, Firefox 50.1.0 and Chrome Version 59.0.3071.86 (on Windows 7 x64 system).
