Analyse the old client	"Check what changes where made in the backend since release 5.5 that could lead to breaking the old client.



Check if they break the backend.



Write a list with the findings (problems in the backend) and talk to Fabian about them."		Improvement	iteraplan Thunderduck	18/May/17 8:37 AM	30/May/17 10:31 AM														"19/May/17 12:52 PM;aan;Result:



The permissions cause problems, the old client does not work with the changes of IPTS-790.



The exel import is broken, as there is a new step.



The merging of User groups and Users might lead to problems.



In general I'd suggest that Roles and Permissions are checked after the changes.
