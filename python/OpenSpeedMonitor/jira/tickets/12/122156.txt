Default language	"Not only UI - also implementation of the functionality.



First section on Standard Configuration page



Name: Default language {color:#14892c}(german: Defaultsprache){color}



Create radio buttons to select default language:

 * User selection {color:#14892c}(german: Benutzer Auswahl){color}

 ** this button doesn't change anything in users view - everyone can choose any language

 * English

 * German



Two last language buttons (as well as other languages specified in the future) should cause following action:

 * language choice disappears from menu

 * chosen language is set as default for all users since next log in,

 ** language chosen and saved earlier for particular user needs to be deleted and replaced with choice made by admin



Buttons should be placed next to each other in one line."
