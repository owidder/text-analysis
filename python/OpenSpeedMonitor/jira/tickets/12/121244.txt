Change main page header	"Hi,



I was wondering how we can change the header that says ""iteraplan - amazing EAM"" after logging in to iteraplan. I was not able to find anything in the documentation.

Matt Bennett"		Technical question	iteraplan Support	12/May/17 3:20 PM	03/Jun/17 7:00 AM														"12/May/17 3:20 PM;mbennett@torontohydro.com;

thank you for your inquiry

You can edit the text for the start view in the data:
 * ""ApplicationResources.properties"" - For the english text 
 * ""ApplicationResources_de.properties"" - For the german text

You find both files in the path:

*""TOMCAT*\webapps\*ITERAPLAN*\WEB-INF\classes\de\iteratec\iteraplan\presentation\resources"".

You need to restart the application for activate the changes.

Greetings,
