After deletion of an attribute the attribute list shows weird information	"In IE 11:



Admin -> Attributes: Delete an existing attribute.



Actual: The list view says below the search field ""Showing x of (x+1) Attributes"". Also a mysterius header above the search field appers: ""Showing all x Attributes"". After pressing F5 everything is fine again.



Expected: No mysterious header. And: ""Showing all x Attributes"" below the search field.
