Reset-Button: Active and Inactive status	"At the moment the reset button (e.g. in List View) is always active, even if the user has not made any changes in the view.



New: Reset should have two states: active and inactive



When the current View is the default view the reset button should be inactive (style see: inactive [Default-Button| https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/display/ITPL/Buttons ]). It switches to active (active Default-Button) when the user makes a change (adds column/changes colour etc.)
