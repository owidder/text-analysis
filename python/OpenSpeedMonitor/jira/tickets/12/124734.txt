In numeric attribute single element view the last editor for the range is broken	"Go to the SEV of Costs.



Deactivate ""Range uniform distributed""



Add two values for bounds



Expected behaviour: The last editor is working ( > value)



Current behaviour its not working and the following stack trace appears:

But fixed another one: case when user saves incorrect bound (lower > upper and vice versa). Editor crashed after getting failed response.	19/Jul/17 2:38 PM;aan;[~dmkh], I just tried to reproduce it and I did not obtain an error, but I could noch change the value. I add I image where the editor is marked. Is this one working at your computer?	19/Jul/17 2:41 PM;dmkh;[~aan], I missunderstood you in the ticket description: "_Add two values for bounds_". I thought you are talking about lower and upper bounds of attribute, but not attribute ranges	25/Jul/17 4:13 PM;mash;Review is done with minor comments: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-813#general-comments	26/Jul/17 10:12 AM;dmkh;Fixed in revision 7447	26/Jul/17 5:25 PM;mash;Review is done with 1 comment: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-813#general-comments
