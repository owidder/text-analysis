[~msr], the server errors are empty with status ""-1"". Shouldn't we create a follow-up ticket to return some meaningful errors from backend?

I want my summary screen back!"	"16/Jun/17 6:44 PM;roia;Summary screen has been broken by revision 7092, task -IPTS-728-



I have fixed it by updating the implementation of revision 7092. [~mash], please review my commit 7117, because I'm not fully familiar with the implementation of -IPTS-728-.



[~fka], I think, you can try now to see the summary screen once more. "	19/Jun/17 6:51 PM;mash;I still get empty errors row and copy to clipboard also copies result to browser console	"20/Jun/17 10:27 AM;roia;In scope of this task: only copy feature.



Proper error messages from backend: separate ticket https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/jira/browse/ITERAPLAN-5380"
