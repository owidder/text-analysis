Analyse and fix: No loading screens in Version 6.0	"In Version 6.0 of iteraplan there are no loadings screens, when you load big lists or diagrams, or open a saved query. 



We have the first request from one of our customers, that he dont know when a list / diagram will be loaded or not. 



Expected a loading screen when the load of a list or diagram takes longer than 5 seconds.



Please discuss the result with [~msr] and merge the commit to the branch of 6.0 "		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	10/Jul/17 9:26 AM	20/Jul/17 4:27 PM														10/Jul/17 9:56 AM;aan;For large data ask [~cst] or [~aan] for the corresponding db-properties.	"17/Jul/17 10:57 AM;aan;Analysis is done. We have to different problems with the list and the diagrams.



In the diagrams a timeout was removed so now the page is loaded after the rendering. Removing the timeout cannot be reverted as this leads to other problems. The problem should be saved in the sub-issue.



The problem with the list was that the complete history was loaded to check if the history is empty. This is not done anymore as checking if the history is enabled is enough (in this case the ""history-enabled""-statement is shown in the history). The second part is already fixed on this ticket."
