"Attribute/date-interval IDs"-related URL config	"*Summary:*

 Currently all queries that have attribute or date interval settings are based on {{persistentNames}}. E.g. sizing in Portfolio diagram, duration intervals in Masterplan, etc.

 After setting different features in diagrams or lists they are saved using {{persistentNames}}.



*Problem:*

 Renaming/deleting of an attribute or date interval cause errors when loading page with saved settings 

 in URL.



*Scope:*

* All diagrams: all possible url-configurations with attributes except for CombinedFilter

* Building Block Type List: column-configuration

* CombinedFilter + update filter-methods in all diagrams and lists



*Solution:*

 Make all configurations working with URL on attribute/date interval *ID* basis.

 Additionally add checking of existence of an attribute or date interval so when an attribute is no longer existing the feature setting is cut or set to default from URL."		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	14/Jun/17 2:31 PM
