Access Issue with Application manager ROle	"Hi Team , 



We have recently deployed 5.4 version. 



Using the interactive client, someone with application manager rights

can delete applications – they can’t in the traditional client. This needs sorting urgently!



Could you please check and help us on this 



Thanks,

Varaprasad

Though user don't have the permission to delete, application showing bin icon and after clicking on it throwing error .. see the attachment. 

Is it possible to hide the icon , if user don't have the permissions ? 

Can we change the text colour of the error message , instead of read can we show it in amber ?

Thanks,
Varaprasad

thanks for your inquiry. 

In version 5.5 it is not possible to hide the icon, because this is part of the list view. 
For the color of the error message is no customizing possible.

I have created a improvement ticket for hiding the ""bin"" icon in future versions of iteraplan.
