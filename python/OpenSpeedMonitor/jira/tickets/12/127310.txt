No loading screens for diagrams	"In Version 6.0 of iteraplan there are no loadings screens, when you load a diagram.



We have the first request from one of our customers, that he dont know when a diagram will be loaded or not. 



Expected a loading screen when the load of a diagram takes longer than 5 seconds.



Please discuss the result with [~msr] and merge the commit to the branch of 6.0 "		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	17/Jul/17 10:38 AM	20/Jul/17 4:27 PM														18/Jul/17 1:52 PM;aan;Merges to the public and private demo are made in the superticket for both cases
