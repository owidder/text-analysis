Third section in Corporate Design tab



In this section user should be able to adjust colours on his website.



Following elements should be showed as a list with a coloured box and colourpicker next to it, only in case of buttons, colourpicker should be located next to particular element that is supposed to be edited.

 {color:#d04437}--> I moved this part to ticket{color} https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/jira/browse/IPTS-1113 {color:#d04437}the user cannot choose the colour of the List headers freely. They are the same as the BBT-colours{color}

 ** {color:#333333}changes the colour of toolarea in diagram view{color}



{color:#d04437}Update II: We decided to let the user choose one colour for buttons and to calculate the other needed shades: If the colour is dark, hover-effect is a brighter shade, if the colour is bright, we use a darker shade. {color}



Every row with colourpicker should also have reset button

 * *undo* icon ""Revert"" {color:#14892c}(ger: Zurücksetzen){color} - secondary text button



Under the list, button to reset all colours to default

 * *undo* icon ""Reset all colours to default"" {color:#14892c}(ger: Alle Farben auf voreingestellte zurücksetzen){color}



Those changes should be saved automatically and visible for other users after next log in."		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	23/May/17 3:09 PM	26/Jul/17 1:53 PM														"17/Jul/17 12:56 PM;msr;[~roia] asks: Could you please clarify in the description what are ""actionButton"", ""defaultButton"", ""primaryTextButton"", ""secondaryTextButton"" and the other options. The best would be a screenshot of some of current pages with arrow-pointers, what parts should be colored by the properties above.



Another question: currently tiles have 2 different background colors: one for normal view and another one when mouse is hovered over the tile. Should both that colors be configurable by user, of we should use some other tile highlighting effect (e.g. box-shadow, etc...)?

"	"17/Jul/17 12:56 PM;msr;I think, Monika means the buttons of the style-guide: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/display/ITPL/Buttons

I don't find the ""secondaryTextButton"" there. Is there anything like this in code?"	17/Jul/17 12:57 PM;msr;For the question" Another question: currently tiles have 2 different background colors: one for normal view and another one when mouse is hovered over the tile.

 We have the following buttons

 # Default-Buttons (like in List View: NEW or FILTER); Dropdown-Buttons (like Diagrams) have this colouring, too

 # Action-Buttons (like in List View: Multi-Mode-Button) 

 # primary Text Buttons (default: pink text)

 # secondary Text Buttons (see List View: Subscription/abonnement-Button)
