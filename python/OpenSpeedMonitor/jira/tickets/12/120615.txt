test google chrome headless	"Questions to answer:



Is it already stable enough?



Can it return an image, for example generated by GoJs



Can it send requests to the server?"		Improvement	iteraplan Thunderduck	05/May/17 10:46 AM	15/May/17 11:57 AM														"12/May/17 10:07 AM;tsc;All answers can be answered with yes, with limitations.



Pro:

 * I didn't experience any problems concerning stability running chrome on command line or from a java runtime.

 * The download can be done with the default download functionality in Chrome:

 ** set the option ""Vor dem Download von Dateien nach dem Speicherort fragen"" to ""no"" (default setting)

 ** set the download folder in the chrome settings



Limitations:

 * The download does not work in headless mode: [https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=696481]

 * Chrome without the headless option needs a GUI, and does not work on a command line linux (typical server environment).

 * The headless option is not yet available on Windows. Workaround is to start without the headless option.
