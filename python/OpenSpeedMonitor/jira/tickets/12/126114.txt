 goJS evaluierung information on Demo Server	"The goJS evaluation information is shown for all visualizations on the [demo server|https://www.iteraplan.de/iteraplan_ee_release/].



The war file works correctly in a local environment (after adapting the db configuration). Building a new client with goJS 1.14 doesn't work either."		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	03/Jul/17 10:36 AM	05/Jul/17 9:26 AM														"03/Jul/17 4:23 PM;tsc;Obviously goJS checks the domain against the license. Since the license is created for iteratec.de and the demo server runs on iteraplan.de the evaluation message is shown.



In this case we need either

- a license for every customer (respectively for every domain iteraplan runs on)

- another license without domain restrictions (""unlimited Applications"", see http://www.nwoods.com/store/p-82-gojs-oem.aspx)"	04/Jul/17 3:56 PM;tsc;iteraplan 6.0.2 deployed with correct license ([howto|https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/display/ITPL/GoJS+Lizenz+verwenden]).
