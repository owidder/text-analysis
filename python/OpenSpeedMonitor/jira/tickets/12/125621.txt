CC dialog for saved queries	"When removing the classic client the saved query migration page and the corresponding functionality should stay.



Strip the migration page from header  (menu) and maybe add a (new) ""Back to iteraplan"" button, which links to the iteraplan Interactive Client Saved Query page.



Add comments to code that cannot be deleted because it is used in the saved query migration, when it can be deleted after the saved query migration is removed.



Do so by adding a new page or refactoring the old one."		New Feature	iteraplan Thunderduck	28/Jun/17 11:11 AM	05/Jul/17 8:53 AM														"04/Jul/17 9:28 AM;aan; commit [27329 |https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/changelog/iteraplan?cs=27329]does belong to this ticket, not IPTS-1062.



The corresponding commit comment should be: Extracted the saved query migration so it is not depending on other JSPs or Java Script."	04/Jul/17 10:29 AM;aan;I deleted customer specific customization so less effort for adapting them is needed.
