Listeners, attached to document in the MPD diagram are not detached.	"There're 2 listeners, which are added to a document when MPD diagram page is accessed:

{code:java}

document.addEventListener('mouseenter', function () {

...



document.addEventListener('click', function (event) {

{code}

When user navigates from the MPD page these listeners remain attached. This can be checked by putting some console.log in the function.

 Also, I have not found when the ""mouseenter"" event handler is called in Firefox.

 Maybe, [~viol]Â could explain this, so as it has been added in revision 7093."		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	07/Jul/17 2:29 PM
