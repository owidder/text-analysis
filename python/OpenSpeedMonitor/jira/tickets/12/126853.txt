LIST VIEW: edit-icon is displayed above content	"In the List view of Business Processes, add the column Strategic values.



*Problem*:



Hover over the values --> the edit icon is displayed. Unfortunately it is displayed above the values in the column. (see Screenshot)



*Solution*:



1. Position the numbers a little further left in order to make space for the edit button. The numbers should still be right-aligned, but with enough space for the edit button, when you hover over the column. You can find an example in the second screenshot. 



2. Please check if this problem occurs for any other numeric column-types in other Lists. 



3. *Another Scenario:* The User clicks on ""New""-button: In the green edit-line this icon should also not obscure anything. "		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	11/Jul/17 4:10 PM						gui	usability
