Singel Element View - Create new element and relations (IE 11) 	"When a new element is created over the single element view, the relation field has no effect in IE 11.

 # Open a Information System in the single element view 

 # Click on the create new button 

 # Click in the field ""Add relation"" 

 # Nothing happens



This problem occurs only in IE "		Bug	iteraplan PO	14/Jul/17 8:38 AM
