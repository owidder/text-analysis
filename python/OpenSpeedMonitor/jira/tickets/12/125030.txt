Same user with small and captial letters breaks iteraplan (server)	"*Scope:*

* Users being created in administration\users (client + server)

* Users being created by iTurm

* LDAP is out of scope



*Reproduce:*

* Create two almost identical users:

** 'Joachim.Vogt'

** 'joachim.vogt'

* Try to login with any user



*Actual:*

* Login is not possible

* Excpetion:



{code:java}

> ""[ERROR] 21-Jun-2017 17:05:09

> [springframework.security.LoginInitializationSuccessHandler] Data 

> source is not available

> de.iteratec.iteraplan.elasticmi.exception.ElasticMiSecurityException: 

> A user with the login name joachim.vogt already exists or the 

> persistent name is invalid""

{code}



*Expected:*

* Login is possible



*Solution idea:*

Ensure it is no longer possible to create two users which only differ in the capital or small letters
