Canceling Filter closes Mass Update	"1. Enable Multi mode. 

2. Open filter. 

3. Set something, for example Name -> arbitrary value. 

4. Click cancel. 

Actual: 

Mass update is closed. 

Expected: 

Mass update is still active"		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	20/Jun/17 10:51 AM	14/Jul/17 10:27 AM														"20/Jun/17 12:01 PM;dmkh;[~fka], [~msr], after investigation I noticed that Combined filter is reloading the page using new URL with previous params. 

This causes creation of new {{ipList}} controller where Mass Update feature is initially disabled.



So I tried at least saving of Mass Update state in URL but this also was causing some exceptions (Mass Update was not developed for working with URL) and additionally it is needed to save rows selection if it was changed.



Due to comments above, needed effort and more or less unique case I decided to move this ticket to ""After 6.0"" sprint"	29/Jun/17 8:08 AM;dmkh;[~viol], as I mentioned in the comment above - it is also needed to save selected rows. In your current implementation all rows are selected after cancelling filter (see attached gif)	"29/Jun/17 9:53 AM;roia;Current implementation reloads the page when filter is cancelled which has many side effects, not just disabling mass update.



E.g., legend gets hidden if it has been displayed, rows selection is reset, etc.



The fix does not resolve such problems.



I'd suggest that we fix this by changing the filter cancelling method in

{code:java}

filterDialogController.js{code}

method 

{code:java}

this.dialogRollback{code}

 



 Things to do: save the filter state from URL, not the whole URL. When user clicks [Cancel] in the filter dialog then just reset the filter with previously saved state and restore URL. Do not reload the page with $route.reload(), like we do now."	14/Jul/17 10:31 AM;viol;Please add revision #7283
