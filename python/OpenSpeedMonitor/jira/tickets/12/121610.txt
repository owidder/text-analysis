thank you for your inquiry.

Can you please describe the problem in two sentences. It helps me to analyse the problem.
Additonally are the screenshots in the correct order?

Hello Mr Stangl. I'm at the airport. But here is a quick description.

We have several spreadsheet reports that use an excel template to format the
data. They all work fine and are used by many people. Then all of a sudden we
get the error message attached earlier.   First. The error message appears on reports with large data. Soon after, we get the error on all reports that use an excel template.
We also get the error if we use the default template (without our configurations). 

However, the report does work if we create a simple list. Other functions of iteraplan work
fine. Our workaround is to restart the application. That works for a few days
and then it fails again. Please advice.
Hannes
"	"23/May/17 1:30 PM;cst;Dear Mr. Callisen,

with version 5.5 (and already some versions before) it is possible to use the Excel power query feature in conjunction with iteraplan. See here for details:

[https://doc.iteraplan.de/display/iteraplan55/REST+access+via+Excel] 

This feature superseeds the spread sheet templating mechanism in the iteraplan Classic Client. We would like to encourage you to switch to this new feature. The iteraplan Classic Client is no longer maintained and we dont fix any issues there anymore.

A small workaround, for the memory overflow, is to restart every night as part of a batch-job.

Greetings,

Christoph Stangl - iteraplan Support

 "	"29/May/17 10:59 PM;hannes.callisen@boehringer-ingelheim.com;For your information, we are already restarting the application every day, but the reporting mechansm still breaks down.  Last Saturday, I had to wait 9 hours before the autmotaed restart scheduled at night Europe time would kick-off.
Furthermore, the new solution requires an Excel add-in that our normal users do not have and cannot easily upload.  In our company, reporting is available to any user, not just priviledged power users."	"31/May/17 2:14 PM;msr;Dear Mr. Callisen.

Thank you for your update.
Our product lead Mr. Kainzinger replied yesterday to Mr. Hermle regarding the restarts of the Tomcat. He will assign a dedicated person in our team to closely collaborate with a contact person of Boehringer Ingelheim to find out how to reproduce the memory and CPU usage which you see on your machines.

Kind regards,

Marcel Schrumpf - iteraplan support"
