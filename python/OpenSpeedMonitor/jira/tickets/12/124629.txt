Same filename for spreadsheet reports	"Hello



Currently when we download spreadsheet reports they all open with the iterplanLandscapeReport,xls file name. This poses a problem because if you want to open multiple reports we either have to save and rename the report or close the first report and open the second report. 



Is there a way to force a new file name for different spreadsheet reports?



Thank you

Thank you for your inquiry.



It is not possible to configure the name of the Spreadsheet reports in the Classic Client.

As a workaround we suggest to use the same functionality in the New Client. There the file names contain a timestamp.



Kind regards,
