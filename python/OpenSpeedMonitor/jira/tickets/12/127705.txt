Remove the remaining classic gui when the saved query migration is removed	"Remove the remaining classic gui when the saved query migration is removed:



In the presentation folder:

 * The complete ajax folder can probably be deleted

 * In dialog only code needed for REST has to be kept (e.g the Import Strategy in the ExcelImport folder)

 * The flow and memory folder can probably be deleted

 * At least some of the problem reports can be removed (Those that cannot be downloaded anymore)

 * In Application Resources all unused strings can be deleted

 * The tags folder can be deleted

 * The Files in the presentation folder directly that are not related to security can be deleted"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	21/Jul/17 9:10 AM
