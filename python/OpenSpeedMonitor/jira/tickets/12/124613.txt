prevent logged in user from login page	"With the anonymous access of iteraplan (IPTS-680) the login page is shown whenever the user requests it.



Before iteraplan 6 the login page was *not* shown, when a user is logged in.

This behaviour should be enabled again:

{code:java}

userSettingsService.loadAllUserSettings().then(function () {

    // don't prevent from login page if an user is logged in already

});

{code}

If the user is not logged in anonymously (flag in permissions). the request for the login page should be ignored or redirected to the home page."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	16/Jun/17 1:42 PM
