Classic Client: Remove User Group Management	"*Summary:*

User Groups do no longer exist (all migrated to users). In the classic client it should not be possible to create new user groups.



Remove the menu entry for user group management and the user group management-jsp itself. Ensure this is also removed in all customizations.



Explicit permissions for user groups (from older iteraplan instances) are not migrated and being ignored. This will be documented in the migration guide."		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	23/May/17 5:08 PM	31/May/17 3:46 PM
