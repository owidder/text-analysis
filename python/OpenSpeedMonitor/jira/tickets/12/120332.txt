Single Element Edit - "Attribute" tab shows not the current values after edit on "all" tab	"Reproduce with trunk and IE 11 

 # Change language to ""Deutsch""

 # Open ""Geschäftsobjekte""

 # Open the single element view of ""KPI""

 # Edit the attribute ""Accountability"" to alice, max and walter

 # Change into the tab ""MERKMALE""

 # Edit the attribute ""Accountability"" 

 # Now there will be only shown one element or nothing

 # You can add the same values again (can be block the database)



The same effect is when you add values on the ""Attrbute""-Tab first and change afterwards to all



Expected That the correct values are shown
