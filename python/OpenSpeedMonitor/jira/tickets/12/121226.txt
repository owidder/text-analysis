Browser scrolling is not working when hovering ag-grid	"*Reproduce:*

 - open Manufacturer attribute in Administration->Attributes;

 - if browser scroller does not appear, add some literals or multiline description;

 - hold mouse cursor on literals list.

 - scroll



*Actual result:*

 - nothing happens, browser scrolling is not working



*Expected result:*

 - page is scrolled.



*Note:*  when hovering ag-grid header or actions column everything works as expected.

 Problem is also reproduced with other pages where ag-grid is used and browser scroller appears.



Check if it is ag-grid feature (for example here [https://www.ag-grid.com/] for first table issue is reproduced only when hovering Name or Country columns).





 If yes - disable this feature for all columns of all lists.

If not - there is a workaround to put literals list to the bottom of the page and fix its height, so there will be no browser scroller at all."		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	12/May/17 1:34 PM	26/May/17 1:24 PM
