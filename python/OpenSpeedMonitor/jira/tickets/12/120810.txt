iteraplan need 10 to 15 minutes on starting the interactive client	"Reproduce with trunk and a special database.



We have two customers with the problem, that iteraplan after 10 to 15 minutes of loading time opens.



The reason for this are ""Attributes"" like Enumeration that have more than 1000 values.



It is a backend problem as the function ""updateContext"" in the backend (ElasticMiContext.java) takes more than 9 minutes. Please investigate which of the subfunction is causing the problem and if it is an elastic loading problem (maybe the model is reloading after adding each attribute?) or a hibernate problem. Hopefully the solution is quite clear after analysing it, otherwise talk to [~fka].

Might be an elastic loading problem, not related to the interactive client. Opening the attribute view in the classic client also takes a long time."	"11/May/17 9:13 AM;aan;To be clarified: What is the aim of the clarification?



Only check if it is and elastic loading problem? What means ""problem"" in this context? The elastic loading is to slow in general for this data size? Or if the speed of the elastic loading decreases with large data?
