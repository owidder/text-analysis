Column width	" * Improve the way the column width is adjusted

 ** See fitColumnWidthsToGrid() and correctWidthOfLastColumn() in ipList-component.js as starting point. Check how many times these methods are called when grid is rendered. Try to avoid multiple calls of these methods."	111840	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	23/Jun/17 1:44 PM	03/Jul/17 9:47 AM														"27/Jun/17 12:04 PM;olal;First part of refactoring:



Removed multiple usage of correctWidthOfLastColumn() in cases:

 - Adding new column - one call instead of \{count of columns} call;

 - QuickSearch - call when scroll appear/disappear instead of each change of quicksearch;



 - Add new list item/Delete item -  call when scroll appear/disappear instead of each creating/deleting;



 - Remove extra call when grid initializating;"	29/Jun/17 3:13 PM;olal;Also I recommend to replace correctWidthOfLastColumn() from method setColumnWidth(), which calls every time when some column was resized, or refactor it, because it not working correctly in this case.	03/Jul/17 9:48 AM;roia;Good recommendation, let's create another subtask for it.
