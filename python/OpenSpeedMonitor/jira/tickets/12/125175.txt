config parameters	 * The {{IpListConfiguration}} takes lots of configuration parameters, like renderers, etc, and they're often omitted, when called from the classes, which inherit it. E.g. {{IpListConfiguration.call(this, $log, $location, $translate, <and here lots of parameters with undefined values>);}}. I suggest to move the parameters to some options-object so that it will not be necessary to pass {{undefineds}} to the constructor. E.g., move the settings to the {{activatedFeatures}} parameter.
