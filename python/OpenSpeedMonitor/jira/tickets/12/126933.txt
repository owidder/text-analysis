 Transform responsiblity attributes of classic to enum attributes in elastic - backend	"*Summary:*

 Rebuild the bridge between classical iteraplan and elastic MI for responsibilty attributes: Ensure that they are transformed to enumeration attributes (not to text).



*As-Is:*

 * Responsibility attributes are transformed to text attributes



*To-Be:*

 * Responsibility attributes are transformed to enumeration attributes with usernames as literals



*Caution:*

 * The elastic metamodel could be changed by the excel or REST-import process (or a future edit function in the new client). So, you could add a ""new literals"" for responsibility attributes, i.e. new users. But these changes should be ignored."
