- open default MPD

- set combined filter, so only 1 element will be in the result set



*Actual*:

Heights of data table (left part) and timespan table (right part) are different (see attached screenshot)



*Expected*:

Heights are the same, independently from number of elements"		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	29/May/17 1:38 PM
