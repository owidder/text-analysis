Single Element Edit - Much text without line brake creates a scroll bar on the bottom of the page	"Reproduce with trunk and a big description field in the single element vie



When you have a big text in the description field, you must scroll down (vertically) to use the horinzontal scrollbar for edit the field. 



The scrollbar is on the bottom of page and not on the bottom of the screen.
