Show hierarchy in cluster diagram header	"The header of a cluster diagram were selected to be capabilities (processes).  These are actually in a hierarchy.  Levels 1 and 2 were selected in the query.  The header shows both levels in a single row.  

How can we display the header in two levels?

See attached PDF with screenshots.

We tried using the hierarchy level filter, but that didn't seem to help.  Please advice what we are missing."		Technical question	iteraplan Support	23/May/17 8:13 PM	26/May/17 4:44 PM														"23/May/17 8:13 PM;hannes.callisen@boehringer-ingelheim.com;

Thank you very much for your inquiry.

If I understand you correctly, you'd like to display each level of hierarchy in the header as a separate ""header-sub-row"". This could look similar to the Landscape Diagram. This is a new feature-request as it is not implemented in iteraplan at the moment.

With the hierarchy filter feature you can change the number of elements in the header, i.e. you actively filter for one or more hierarchy levels. But this has no effect on the view. They are displayed in one row in any case.

A work-around could be to create an attribute for the hierarchy level and color by this attribute. The attribute could be automatically filled by a reaction-script (which needs to be developed).


If you want to, I could send this new feature-request to the Product Management Team ( direct@iteraplan.de ). Would you like me to do that for you?

Kind regards,

"	"26/May/17 2:06 PM;hannes.callisen@boehringer-ingelheim.com;hello Mr. Schrumpf - thank you for the response.  Yes, the functionality is similar to that in the landscape diagram.  And yes, it would be usefull to also have it in the cluster diagram.  Yes, i would encourage you to submit this suggestion to the development team.
:-) hannes
BTW, the coloring option is not possible for us because we already use it to represent the type of process (capability).
