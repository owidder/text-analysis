thank you for your inquiry.

The line types cannot be changed in the ""Information Flow Diagram"". 
In our migration guide for 6.0 you find the following part: 


|Line Type & Caption|Choose line type|Function no longer available|Line types are automatically generated|
|Line caption settings|Function no longer available|


[https://doc.iteraplan.de/display/iteraplan60/Visualizations] 

The ""Graphics Reactor"" can be used for your usecase to change the edge line type.

Greetings,

Christoph Stangl - iteraplan Support"	"21/Jul/17 10:08 AM;ansgar.marsiske@coface.com;Ok - I understand, but why did you reduce the functionality in the new client?
this was very helpful in the past and the alternative with Graphics Reactor is very heavy work in comparison to the easy handling in the past. The way to set it without the possibility to change it is very bad.

May I propose an new feature for next version:
Let define the line type in the definition of attributes as you do it for colors. Then the attribute, if used in an interface will be dispolayed always in the same way."	"21/Jul/17 12:47 PM;cst;Dear. Mr. Marsiske,

I have forwarded this request to iteraplans Product Management team.

Thank you for your good idea.
At the moment we are planning to improve the Information Flow Diagram within the next releases as this is a very important diagram to a lot of our clients. During this process of redesign we take your suggestion into account.

Thanks

Marcel Schrumpf"
