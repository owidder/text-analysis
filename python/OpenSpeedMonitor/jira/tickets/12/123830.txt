Change Interface/InfoFlow structure	"Change the meta model structure regarding Interfaces and Information Flows: See the structure image attached. (Blue color denotes current structure in elastic.) Elastic and Hibernateo/DAOs should have the same structure, as far as possible.



Especially: Promote the Interface element, make it a fully fledged stand-alone element. It's now called Information Flow, other tickets still refer to it as Interface.



Also: Cleanup all special handlings in iteraplan (and the NIC code) regarding info flows and interfaces. Be aware that all relations are now attributable.
