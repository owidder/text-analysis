Adapt new client to usage with iframes	"The idea is that one can include the images via iframe, so that code is executed and then the image is shown



Therefore the new client needs a serperate URL such that the images is shown in the iframe. Hence it should not be downloaded but shown in the browser window. (Showing the intermediate steps is ok)



The direct download should not be possible anymore.



Please also add this function to the user docu.



Please check all diagram types, in the moment it looks like LSD is not working."		Improvement	iteraplan Thunderduck	16/May/17 12:45 PM	31/May/17 10:42 AM
