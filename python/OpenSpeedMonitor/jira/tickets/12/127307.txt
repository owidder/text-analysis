Saved Queries: Do not show Building Block Types "on the path" of NCD	"*Summary:*

In the Saved Query screen do not display the Building Block Types which are on the path between outer and inner type of a Nested Cluster Diagram.



*Reproduce:*

* Open a NCD

* Change outer type to Architectural Domain

* Save the Query

* Open Saved Query Screen



*Actual:*

* The saved queries table displays also Technical Components



*Expected:*

*Note:*

* But the current permission check should not be changed - only the view on the screen"		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	17/Jul/17 9:59 AM
