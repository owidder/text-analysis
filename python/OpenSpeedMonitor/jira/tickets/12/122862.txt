Sub information Systems cannot be choosen in as self relations	"Go to the single element view of an Information System.



Go to add relation and choose a different Information System.



Expected behaviour: Sub information System is given as an option.



Current behaviour: Only the other six options are given.



Â 



It looks like this could be a problem of the view, when the browser window is made very small for example only one option is shown and no scrolling is possible."		Bug	iteraplan PO	30/May/17 3:40 PM	11/Jun/17 1:47 PM
