Numeric coloring is broken in Pie Chart	"Steps to reproduce:

1) Open default Pie Chart

2) Set attribute to Costs

3) Change color schema in the legend to ""Dark to light""

4) Click iteraplan logo then go back to Pie Chart diagram

5) Open filter

6) Set ""Accountability is max""



Actual result: coloring is broken, few segments are colored in the same color, some colors from palette (see legend) are not used

Expected result: coloring and numeric palette is updated due to new elements set after filtering, all colors in Pie Chart are based on palette



Notes: 

- after refresh (F5) numeric coloring is correct;

- after resetting view and doing all steps (except 4) coloring is correct;

- probably numeric ranges used for coloring are not updated in {{onInit() (pcdConfiguration.js)}}, please check this. Numeric coloring in PCD and BCD need to know actual numeric ranges on which palette is built.
