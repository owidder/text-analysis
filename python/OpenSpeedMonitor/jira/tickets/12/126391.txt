Messages for invalid time spans can lead to errors that make the import break	"When importing a time span with invalid date (for example ""-1"") this leads to a null pointer exception.



This is interpreted as the start and end time are not fitting together and then the according dates are evaluated for the error message.



This breaks the first step of the import.



Expected behaviour: there is an error message that states the problem."		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	05/Jul/17 2:24 PM	06/Jul/17 11:02 AM
