Analyse Performance of Manual Filter in IE11	"*Summary:*

Analyse the performance of Filter in IE11 for a list of 3000 elements



*Details:*

* Follow-up of IPTS-717

* Create a list of 3000 elements or take a big database to reproduce

* In IE11 it takes about 5 minutes to load the manual selection filter, in firefox and chrome about 3-6 seconds

* Analyse why there is such a big difference

* Try to optimise this code for IE11 so the performance is similar to Chrome and Firefox



*Note:*

* Please check if this is related to the lazy loading of the manual filter tab"		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	12/Jun/17 1:27 PM	14/Jul/17 1:37 PM														12/Jul/17 8:59 AM;anhv;The main performance issue was ng-repeat directive, cause it is not so productive for big data (especially in IE), also this issue might be in Attribute Groups page for a big attributes array
