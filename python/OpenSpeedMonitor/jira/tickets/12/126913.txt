Language when changing form new to old client	"When my iteraplan is in English and I switch to the old client for migrating saved queries the language of the old client is German (probably because my browser is german).



In case this should be changed one can probably add the ?locale=en or ?locale=de to the link depending of the language choosen in the new client"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	12/Jul/17 9:29 AM
