Edit issues in interactive client	"We’ve spotted

a bug in the interactive client – this one’s important. In the

interactive client you can add columns to the normal view and edit the data

directly in there – however this also allows you to edit data which you should

not have authorisation for. An example – Sebastian Reh is not able to edit the

KPI non relevant field in classic client, however is able to edit it in the

interactive client."		Fault	iteraplan Support	24/Jul/17 10:28 AM															24/Jul/17 10:53 AM;varaprasad.vegesina@uniper.energy;The Iteraplan version is 5.4 not 3.4. 	"25/Jul/17 11:00 AM;msr;Dear Varaprasad.

Thank you for your inquiry.

Could you please get back in
touch with Iteratec regarding this bug. It is a huge impact on our data
integrity if this bug is not fixed – to the point where we will have to disable
the interactive client. I’d like it escalated, and some answer about what we
can do to mitigate it.
