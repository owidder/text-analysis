thank you for your reply.

Can you please send me the follwoing Log-Files too for analyse your problem on copy ""Information Systems"".
Additional the time when the error occured. 

The “catalina.out” and “localhost.log” files from your tomcat installation (just for the period, when the error occurred).

From [Tomcat]/webapps/[iteraplan directory]/WEB-INF/classes:

 

The iteraplan log files from the period, when the error occurred. The files are called “iteraplan-[version].log” (for today) or „iteraplan-[version].log.[TIMESTAMP]” (for past days). The location of these file was specified during installation and is documented in the file “log4j.properties”.

Greetings,

Christoph Stangl - iteraplan Support"	"21/Jul/17 10:29 AM;ansgar.marsiske@coface.com;Checking the log4j-file of the actual
Iteraplan installation it shows me that all logfiles are located on the server
under:
C:/Program Files/Apache Software
Foundation/Tomcat 7.0/logs/

 In here I can find 

-         
catalina.2017-07-20.log

-         
localhost_access_log.2017-07-20.txt

 
This path 

From [Tomcat]/webapps/[iteraplan directory]/WEB-INF/classes:

Should be the location of the
log4j-file, right?


There are another three files from July,
20th 2017:

-         
iteraplan-6.0.0-nc.txt

-         
iteraplan-6.0.0.txt

-         
localhost_access_log.2017-07-19.txt

Please find the complete list as a

[^iteraplan-6.0.0.log] _(207 kB)_"	"21/Jul/17 1:03 PM;cst;Thank you very much for sending us the log files.

We cannot reproduce the error, it is possible to send us a DUMP of your database 
 and the name of the ""Information System"" which should be copied.

Have you tried other ""Information Systems"" too, or appears the error every time you want to copy a element? 

Greetings,

Christoph Stangl - iteraplan Support"	"21/Jul/17 4:58 PM;ansgar.marsiske@coface.com;yes, I tries with other IS - it is still the same behaviour.
see appendex for more information.

we will send a dump - I ordered it...

We tried again to reproduce it. If you want, you can also double-check it in the public demo of iteraplan 6.0: https://demo.iteraplan.de/iteraplan_ee_release/client/



We could not reproduce the first behaviour which leads to an error. But we could reproduce the problem with duplicated entries in the list view. This seems to be a presentation problem. If you refresh your browser window, the second (non-existing) entry disappears. Can you confirm this behviour on your local environment?



Kind regards,



Marcel Schrumpf"	"26/Jul/17 10:21 AM;thomas.liskow@coface.com;If I refresh the browser window the further entry disappear.

But the problem of copying an IS with attribute values occurs furthermore. The same problem for technical components.

The copy with attr values works for infrastructure elements and business objects. But there the double display of this copied elements occurs, too."
