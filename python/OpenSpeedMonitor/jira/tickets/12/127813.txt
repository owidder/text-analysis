 User exits Custom Dashboard and edit-mode but button stays active 	"*Reproduce:* Go to Custom Dashboard, click edit and go back to the tile-view. Then go back to Custom Dashboard. The edit-Button is still ""active"" but the textfield has closed.



*Expectation:* Set the Button-status back to normal (gray) when the user exits the page."		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	24/Jul/17 11:48 AM
