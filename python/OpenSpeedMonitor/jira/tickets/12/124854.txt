- There is no service for getting corresponding permissions for current user. 

- Using roles service could be possible for this, but it is also dependent on ""Edit role..."" pemission and used for viewing and editing ROLE permission but not user's. 

- User service return basic info of all users. 

- Permissions service returns only functional permissions."	04/Jul/17 5:08 PM;dmkh;Review is done, 2 comments are here: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-754#general-comments	10/Jul/17 4:05 PM;mash;Further improvements are in the next ticket: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/jira/browse/IPTS-1100	14/Jul/17 4:44 PM;vadm;Review is done https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-769
