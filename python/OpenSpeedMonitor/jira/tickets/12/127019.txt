F: SEV: Add an accountability in Attribute-Tab - hidden buttons	"*Scenario*: The user goes to Information System Domains > centrally managed Systems and changes to attribute-tab. Here the user changes value of ""accountability"".

The buttons to add or discard the values are obscured by the bottom-div.



*ToDo*: Adjust the space between the content (Default Attribute Group-box) and the text below (Last Modification)

Please use approximately the same distance as in the ALL-tab. (about 2.5cm).



Check whether this problem occurs in any more tabs."		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	13/Jul/17 12:41 PM
