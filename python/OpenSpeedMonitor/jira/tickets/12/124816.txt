Improve import warning for parallel imports	"This could improve the import functionality:



Notify other users that are on the import/export page and have the information that they cannot start an import, when the import stopped.



Better warning when a second user (that was on the import page before the import started, and hence can start the import, but the first step fails). Right now it only shows error: 423_Locked or something like that
