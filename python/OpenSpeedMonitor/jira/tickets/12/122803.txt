thank you for your inquiry. 

This is how the filter works, the CONTAINS NOT relational operator has a special meaning when applying it to lists.
 Creating a query for watchers NOT CONTAINING Tim will show all elements having at least one watcher who is not Tim(although Tim may be included in the list too) or no watcher at all.

You can found the whole part in our current iteraplan documentation:

[https://doc.iteraplan.de/display/iteraplan55/Formulating+queries]

Greetings,

Christoph Stangl - iteraplan Support"	"30/May/17 10:01 AM;thomas.koch@monier.com;Dear Service Desk, 
as you see in our problem description we did not only use ""contains not"" condition. 
The query does not work in the expected way when using ""is not"" condition. 
Please advice.
Kind Regards Thomas Koch"	"31/May/17 10:33 AM;thomas.koch@monier.com;Dear Service Desk, 

can you please send us a feedback to our last statement from yesterday 10:01h?
Thank you.

Kind Regards
Thomas Koch"	"31/May/17 4:00 PM;msr;Dear Mr. Koch.

The implemented filter work as follows:

It uses an ""Existential quantifier"", i.e. it asks: ""Is there at least one which fullfills my criterion?"" In the iteraplan documentation (https://doc.iteraplan.de/display/iteraplan55/Filtering ) it is described as the following:


{noformat}
Pitfall
Assume you have an information system that is connected to two information system domains with the names ""A"" and ""B"". If you filter ""Assigned Information System Domains"" where ""name is not A"", the information system will be in the result set. The reason is, that the information system domain ""B"" fullfills the criterion, as its name is not ""A"", and it is connected to the information system.
{noformat}

This example of the documentation matches your case. The element is in the result set of ""is not A"" because it has at least one elment-connection which ""is not A"".

Kind regards,
