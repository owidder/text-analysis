New Enumeration attributes have not visible literals list	"*Reproduce*

 1. Create new Enum attribute

 2. Add at least 1 literal

 3. Save it

 4. Open it again from list



*Actual*

Literals list is not visible



*Expected*

{color:red}UPDATE: {color} Step 3 (saving) should not be possible without assigning it to a Building Block Type.

Prohibit it in the client to create any attribute without assigning it to a Building Block Type (same applies to removing of assigned Building Block Types)

In this case show the message: ""Please assign a Building Block Type"" / GER ""Bitte weisen Sie einen Bebauungselement-Typ zu""
