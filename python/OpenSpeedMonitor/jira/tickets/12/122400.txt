Wrong coloring in BCD.	"Steps to reproduce:

1. Create new enum attribute with some literals and make it available for some bbt (i.e. information systems).

2. Open bcd with Information System as content type and this attribute as attribute - BCD with one bar (unspecified) is created with default coloring (light red color for information systems)

3. Select coloring by any attribute (i.e Accountability) - bar turns to grey (as if all information systems has no accountability specified).



To Be:

Bar should be colored into colors of literals of accountability according to assigned values."
