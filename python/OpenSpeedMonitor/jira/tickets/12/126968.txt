Colorpicker dont work correctly in the "Enumeration Attribute" 	"Reproduce with trunk

 # Open ""Administration"" and ""Attributes""

 # Open ""CRUD""

 # Open the colorpicker for one of the values

 # Click on ""HEX""

 # Try to change the color and click on select

 # Nothing happens

 # When you enter a color hex code manuel and click on select 

a error appears (that only happens in 6.0)



Expected: That you change the color 

Actual: You cant change the color"		Bug	iteraplan PO	12/Jul/17 2:49 PM
