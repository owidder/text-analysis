Attribute Groups with one attribute will not be shown in the single element view	"Steps to reproduce in version 6.0 and can reprodruce only with customer databases which do the update from 5.5 to 6.0 



Ask me for the database dumps

 # Open Administration - Attribute Groups

 # Look for a Attribute Group with one element

 # Check, where the attribute will be used e.g. information system

 # Open a information system and the attribute group will not be shown



When in the attribute group are more then one attributes, then it will be shown. 

When you create a new attribute group in 6.0 and add a attribute from the same buildingblock all attribute groups will shown. After deleting the new created attribute group, the ""old"" ones are not be shown anymore.



Actual: Old attribute groups with one attribute will not be shown in single element view

Expected: That the attribute groups will be shown correctly"		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	14/Jul/17 10:50 AM															"17/Jul/17 8:51 AM;cst;I found the reason why it works on new created elements. 

The attribute groups in which the problem appears have ""*Show these attributes next to the core attributes""* activated."	"21/Jul/17 9:10 AM;tsc;2 days ago I experienced the described behaviour 2 or 3 times, but not reproducable in a deterministic way.



Now everything is behaving like it should be: the attribute is shown how it is configured (next to the core attributes or in a separate block)."
