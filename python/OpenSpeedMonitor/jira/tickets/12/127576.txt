Graphics Reactor: empty folder info-message	"When the folders are shown as Icons (not as list) the message ""no files in this folder"" looks a little old-fashioned.



*Improvement:* New style and new text, that motivates the user to take action.



*ToDo:*

1. Remove the yellow info-message and all code.



2. The new message should look like in the screenshot ""noFilesInFolderNew.png"".



3. Change the text in both versions (icon- & list-view): eng: ""Please upload new files."" / ger: ""Laden Sie neue Dateien hoch."" Where ""files"" and ""Dateien"" are links (in #A70075), that open an upload dialogue (same functionality as the upload-button in the header).
