Mass update - [Add] button missing for Accountability	"Open list of information systems, add ""Accountability"" column.



Turn the ""Multi mode"" on and select ""Accountability"" column



Result: the editor has [Set], [Remove], [Clear] buttons



Expected: there's also [Add] button



*Update:* the same issue with relations (e.g., ""Based On Technical Components"" column in the list of Information Systems)
