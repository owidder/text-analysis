Diagrams - Colorpicker will be closed directly (IE 11)	"Reproduce with trunk, IE 11 and big data 

 # Open the pie chart diagram 

 # Open the legend

 # double click on a color 

 # The colorpicker opens and will be closed directly 



On the Firefox and Chrome this does work correctly



Expected: That I can pick a color :)

Actual: I cannot pick a color"		Bug	iteraplan PO	03/May/17 1:29 PM	05/May/17 5:53 PM														"05/May/17 5:53 PM;fka;Color picker opens with a single click
