Download-Button triggers download-dialogue in Corporate Dashboard	"*Summary*: The Download button in Report>Corporate Dashboard should trigger a download-dialogue.



*Actual:* When clicking on the Download-Button in Dashboard, the xsl-file is only displayed, not downloaded



*Expectation:* Dialogue for download is displayed.



*ToDo*

1. Provide a download-dialogue for this file when Download-button is clicked.

2. Remove the links from the name ""corporate-dashboard.xsl"". Just leave the it in different font than the rest of the text.

The server should return this headers for this file types:



{{Content-Type: application/octet-stream}}



{{Content-Disposition: attachment;filename=\""corporate-dashboard.xsl\""}}"	"26/Jul/17 11:42 AM;roia;Idea: implement some endpoint on server. e.g. GET: downloadFile/<filename> or downloadFile/?file=<filename> which would return the file specified with the proper headers
