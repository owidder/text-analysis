Filter Diagram and List - Datefield is corrupt	"Reproduce with trunk or nightly

 # Open the Landscape Diagram

 # Open the ""Column filter"" and set Productive period - between

 # Now try to enter a date in the first or second field like 05/01/2000

 # The date will be changed to 01/05/2000  

 # When you want to edit the 2000 the date picker opens, when you close it and try to change the 2000 to 2001 he makes a random 0 into the date 

 # Other strange things happens too, that the date was set to 01/01/200 



Expected: That the date will correctly set

Actual: Strange things are occurring

Thank you for this detailed analysis. The legend format is wrong, but I would see that in scope of IPTS-859 and out of scope for this task."
