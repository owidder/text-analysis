Reactor input fields not always red	"In the edit dialog of the reactor all input fields of the section ""Publish output file"" are marked in red, even if the section is not checked.



Please mark them only as invalid if the section is checked. Please change the color of the hints to blue as they are always shown, even if the user did not start to insert anything.



*User Story:*



The user adds a file to the Graphics Reactor. Then he chooses the file and clicks on edit in the Script Configuration. The edit dialog opens and he does not want to publish the output file. The hints in the publish output file are normal and he can easily ignore them.
