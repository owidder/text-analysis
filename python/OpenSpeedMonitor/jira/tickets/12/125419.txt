!NOT READY! LIST VIEW: Multi Mode UI	"#  When the user clicks Multi Mode button, show *the textfields* *of all columns* at a time. They can be edited parallely. There is no need for opening and closing them one by one.

 The cursor is in the textfield for name or in the textfield of the first column if name is not in the list.

 # When the cursor is in a textfield, this textfield and the buttons ""Prepend/Append/set"" that belong to this column are *active*.

 # The input of the user remains in the textfield until the user clicked ""*append*"" etc.:

 *Scenario*: A user types something into the textfield of Name, and he does not click append/prepend. He then changes into the textfield of Description. The information in the Name-column will *remain in that textfield*, until user comes back to it.





 # Once the user has clicked ""set"" in one column, the text in that textfield is marked and the cursor set at the end of the text. 

 # If the user closes the MultiMode, before clicking ""set"" etc. in one column, the concerning textfield and buttons should be activated and the user should get an *alert* *eng:* ""Do you really want to leave MultiMode? Changes for ""<name of column>"" will be discarded."" and the buttons ""STAY"" ""LEAVE"" *ger:* ""Wollen Sie den Multi Modus wirklich verlassen? Änderungen an ""<name of column>"" werden verworfen."" buttons: ""BLEIBEN"" ""VERLASSEN"".





 # Please remove the alerts ""all changes will be lost"", that appear when the user changes into another textfield.





 # Please remove the close-buttons and icons in each column and all remove all concerning code (open/close/hover over for opening). The boxes stay ""open"" all the time.





 # Change the *colours*:

 background colour from yellow to #A70075 

 text-colour: #fff

 icons in white: close,subscribe, unsubscribe, delete (see attachments)

 button-background-colour: #C75CA7

 # The different columns of MULTI MODE have different *heights*: ""Actions"" is higher that the others. Please use the same height as for the normal gray List-header."
