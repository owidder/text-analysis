Add new import for demo data	"Remove the XMI interface, which is used for importing demo data, from the client. Implement this import via a new way, e.g. DB dump. Be aware that the demo data contains saved queries, which can't be imported via Excel, REST or similiar as of now.



Also convert the currently present saved queries in the bank demo data set from classicÂ client to interactive client saved queries."

For JSON add a data mapper,or check if there is already something to map JSON to the DB. SQL is probably easier."
