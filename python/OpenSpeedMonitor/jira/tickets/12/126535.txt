Single Element View UI: modify edit-icons behind text	"Situation: In the SEV there are {color:#14892c}edit-icons{color} that appear when the mouse hovers over text-elements like ""name, description, status, productive period ""etc. In the boxes ""Relations"" and ""Self-Relations"" we have the same event with delete- icons.



These icons are not well aligned with the text. The icons appear to hang lower than the text.



ToDo:

 # For the delete-icons, please use the trash-can icon instead of the cross for consistency with other screens. --> oder doch so lassen? aber graues Icon?

 # Please position all of the icons a little higher, as in the mockup in the attachment.

 # Make sure the space between text and icons is always the same (behind description, there is currently no space at all)."		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	06/Jul/17 3:03 PM
