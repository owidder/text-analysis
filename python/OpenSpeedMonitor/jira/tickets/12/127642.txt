[^iteraplan 6 filter.docx] _(154 kB)_"	"20/Jul/17 1:28 PM;cst;Greetings,

thanks for your inquiry. 

If you want a list of all ""Name is ..."" in the interactive you can use the ""Manuel Selection"" filter.
 # Open the list view 
 # Open ""Edit Filter"" 
 # Change to the ""Manuel Selection"" 
 # Here are all Names of e.g. Information Systems  

In the ""Manuel Selection"" filter you can search for ""Names"" too. 
Additional when you set a filter like ""Name starts with S"" the ""Manuel Selection"" filter will be updated and shows only the Information Systems with ""S"" on the begining. 

Greetings,

Christoph Stangl - iteraplan Support "	"20/Jul/17 2:14 PM;ansgar.marsiske@coface.com;Hello,

that is not my problem.
I want to select e.g. all technical components with an architectural domain but I don't know the possible values. Then either I must know the name like ""Communication"" or I must know the existing values in architectural domains. In old view I can see all values and by typing a part of the name the selection list became shorter. it was much more comfortable to search because you must not know what are the possible values."

Thank you for the detailed explanation.

We fully understand your use case and why you'd prefer the implementation iteraplans classic client filter. We take the suggestion with us and think about improving the filter dialogue in the next releases.



Thank you
