LIST-VIEW UI: animation of column drag & drop	"In List View: The drag and drop of columns works well. But the animation still looks a little old fashioned. Let's make this modern:



-Have a look at the drag&drop-function on our Jira-Boards.-

 -Note: The element which is dragged always looks the same. You have the feeling of picking it up, because it leaves its space (the space is left empty). While dragging the object, the possible destinations are delineated clearly, while the rest looks ""inactive"".-

 -When the element is in the right position to let it drop, the destination area changes colour.-



-Our implemention will be similar. Please open the attachment with the ppt-Mockup while reading the following steps.-



-ToDo:-

 # -When the user picks up a column, the column should leave its place. The floating column has a shadow (left, right, bottom). The empty space becomes a gray box with dashed border (slide 2).-

 #  -All possible destinations for the floating column are outlined by gray boxes with gray dashed lines, too (slide 2).-

 # -Add an animation to this: when a column is being picked up, all other columns become a little narrower to make space for the gray destination-boxes. (It should look like the columns move a little to make space for the gray destination-boxes).-

 #  -When the floating column is dragged into a place where it can be dropped into a destination-box, this box should change colour: The border becomes green (slide3).-

 -This means, that the space, that is left empty by picking up the column has a green border at first (since the user mightjust let it drop back into its origin place, slide 2).-

 # -When the floating column hovers over a destination box, this box is expanded (maybe with a few milliseconds delay from hovering-event?): the other columns move to the left or right to make space for the floating column.-

 -If possible the floating column should shrink a little and float into its new place on its own (slide 4).-

 # -When the user drops the column, it ""falls into place"" and the other columns expand to their original size, gray destination-boxes dissapear.-



{color:#FF0000}*Update:*{color} Just use smooth ag-grid animation of columns reordering. Also make drag-label look in more modern way (aggreed with [~sbu])."
