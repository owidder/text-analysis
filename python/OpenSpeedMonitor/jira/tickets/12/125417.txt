LIST-VIEW and OTHERS UI: Add Columns = Dropdown	"The Input-field ""Add Column/Add Relation"" has also dropdown function. By the look, the user doesn't expect that. --> We should make this option visible.Â 



*ToDo:*

 # Please add the typical dropdown-arrow as in the screenshot in the attachment. The arrow points upwards when the dropdown is open.

 # Change the default text from ""Add column"" to ""Add column..."" (respectively add the dots in German and for ""Add Relation..."" in Single Element View).

 # Please use the same text-colour as in the search-field.

 # Make sure the style is changed in every screen: List View, Single Element View (Self-Relations and Relations), Roles&Permissions, Users"		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	26/Jun/17 11:24 AM	21/Jul/17 9:21 AM					gui	usability
