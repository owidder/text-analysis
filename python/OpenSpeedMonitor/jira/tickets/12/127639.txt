Information Systems: Add Relations	"Has to be done on top for all kinds – not per relation as before.



It is hard to find the right relation value if all relation types has to be selected by only one combo box! Also the combo box does not show all values – it seems to be limited to about 24 values, the rest is not shown.

Thank you for inquiry.



Do I understand you correctly?

To create a new relation on the Single Element View of an element you have to click in an empty input field ( https://doc.iteraplan.de/display/iteraplan60/Single+Element+View ). This is a searchable dropdown, i.e. you can enter the first letters of the element you'd like to add. Then the dropdown list will be updated.



If I understood you correctly, then this is the intended behaviour of the new User Interface.



Kind regards,



Marcel Schrumpf"
