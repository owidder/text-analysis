Returning JSON body could resolve this issue (probably have different URLs for client or some parameters/headers in the request, which wold help to distinguish if we need response in JSON or HTML).

 # Response with 401 status is not error, but correct behavior. Reducing number of requests can be implemented after anonymous login task is completely finished: after, or in scope of ITERAPLAN-5387. Or just don't care about them, because it will require refactoring of most of pages, which use $routes' resolve property to preload data from multiple URLs"
