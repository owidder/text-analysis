NCD. Change colors for num attributes doesn't always work	"Timebox: 1



Related to ITERAPLAN-4395



Change colors for num attributes only works if the language or 'undefined'-color was changed.



Steps to reproduce:

* Open NCD in IC

* Select an inner element

* Color inner elements by costs (Toolarea => Inner color => costs)

* Change from color picker color of maximum or minimum



Expected:

=> The coloring of inner elements should be changed



Actual:

=> No color changes happen



However if the language or 'undefined'-color was changed, coloring works again. 

Even more, color changes already done will be visible after the language or 'undefined'-color was changed."		Bug	iteraplan PO	08/Jun/16 10:50 AM	29/Jun/16 2:54 PM														"08/Jun/16 12:13 PM;sfe;May be fixed automatically when properly integrating color picker with legend.

Thus it's best to take another look at this issue once ITERAPLAN-4545 was done, except if this won't happen for the next release"
