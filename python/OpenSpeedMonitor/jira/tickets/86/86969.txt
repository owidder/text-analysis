Filters broken past operator selection	"_Reproduce:_

# Go to for example NCD in interactive client

# Edit filter for inner elements

# Add filter for Complexity, then select as operator ""no value""



_Expected:_ Display updates to only show elements with no values in ""Complexity""



_Actual:_ Display doesn't change



_Another reproducer:_

# Go to for example NCD in interactive client

# Edit filter for inner elements

# Add filter for Costs, select operator ""between"" and change the slider values

# Close filter dialog

# Open filter dialog again



_Expected:_ Re-opened dialog shows the formerly set slider values



_Actual:_ Slider values are reset to initial values





In case those two reproducers are not caused by the same underlying problem, please create subtasks and send them to [~sfe]."
