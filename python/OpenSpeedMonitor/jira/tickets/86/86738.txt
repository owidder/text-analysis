Introduce GULP and make Configurations localizable	"Introduce GULP (because [~mwe] knows that better than GRUNT and GULP and GRUNT are nearly the same)

* Use one file per task

* Review the current GRUNT tasks if they are currently necessary or not



Change the configured GRUNT tasks to GULP tasks in the Jenkins. 



Localize configurations (one for Jenkins and one for the developer, more are possible)

* constants.js

* karma.conf.js

* karma.integration.conf.js

* karma_combined.conf.js

* conf.js"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	08/Jun/16 11:54 AM
