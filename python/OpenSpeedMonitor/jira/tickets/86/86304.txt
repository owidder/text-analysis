Sorting and displaying by hierachical names	"*Summary:*

New option: Sort (and display) by hierachical names



*As-Is:*

* No other sorting or displaying options are possible



*To-Be:*

* The user can choose between ""normal"" (=non-hierachical) and hierarchical names as criterion for displaying and alphabetical sorting.



*Implementation Details:*

* Save in the actual state in the url

* Default is normal names

* The sorting can be different for each level, e.g. Level 1: Hierarchical names, Level 2: Normal name

* If the user choose hierachical sorting (and displaying) for this level, all Building Blocks are displayed with hierarchical name (grandparent (if exists) : parent (if exists) : parent (if exists) : ... : actual element) and sorted by these hierarchical names ascending



*UI:*

* Legend: Nothing is displayed

* Toolarea: Create a new main entry:

** Main entry: ""Display"" (German: ""Anzeige"")

** Subentries: ""Level 1"", ""Level 2"" (if existis), ""Level 3"" (if exists)

** Sub-subentries: Toogle-Button: ""Non-hierarchical names"" / ""Hierarchical names"" (German: ""Nicht-hierarchische Namen"" / ""Hierarchische Namen""

* Extend Business Object with new functionalty for getting hierarchical names (lazy initialised and cached) and saved as private property

* This getter can be used in the mpdDataService



* UI: Simply cut the names if they are too long (already implemented at the moment) -> need for a follow-up ticket."	"23/Jun/16 1:02 PM;msr;Thanks [~dmkh]:
