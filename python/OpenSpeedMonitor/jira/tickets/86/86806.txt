Rename misleading export- import rights	"*Summary:*

The naming of the export and import rights are wrong, please correct:



* ""Run import (Excel)"" (as-is) = ""Run import and export"" (to-be)

* ""Run import (XMI)"" (as-is) = ""Run legacy XMI-import"" (to-be)

*  ""Run export (XMI)"" (as-is) = ""Run legacy XMI-export"" (to-be)"		Bug	iteraplan PO	09/Jun/16 9:35 AM	15/Jun/16 1:29 PM														"09/Jun/16 12:51 PM;msr;[~fka] : ""Dann bitte gleich machen!



Danke

"	"14/Jun/16 5:15 PM;tam;There are still some properties, which need to be renamed.

*ApplicationResourcesCustomBM.properties*

role.permission.ExcelImport=Run import (Excel)  

role.permission.XmiDeserialization=Run import (XMI)  

role.permission.XmiSerialization=Run export (XMI)  



*ApplicationResources_de.properties*

role.permission.ExcelImport=Ausf√ºhren von Import (Excel)  



Please clear if properties from iteraplan-common-base should be also renamed



"	14/Jun/16 5:46 PM;aan;Renaming the  properties from iteraplan-common-base is not necessary in the moment
