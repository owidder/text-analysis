Distrigation in the MPD: 1. Add hierarchy filter	"*Summary:*

Add hierarchy filter (like in the Landscape Diagram).



*As-Is:*

* No hierarchy filter exists



*To-Be:*

* Hierarchic filtering is possible, i.e.

** A hierachic filter (additionally to the ""normal"" filters) exists for Level 1, Level 2 and Level 3

** For each diagram level the user can only show elements of a certain level, e.g. only show elements with hierachy level 2 (=only the children of the top-level-elements and no other elements are shown in the diagram)

** Default is ""All levels"" (=hierarchy filter is deactivated)



*Implementation Details:*

* Use the functionality of CombinedFilter.js

* Check the Landscape Diagram implementation of this feature

*  Save the hierachy-filter in the url



*UI:*

* Legend: Display the actual hierachy-filter in the legend (if it is not the default-filter = all levels) and use the LegendFilterBuilder

* Toolarea:

** Main entry: ""Filter""

** Sub-entries: ""Level 1"", ""Level 2"" (if exists) and ""Level 3"" (if exists)

** Sub-entries of Sub-entries: ""Edit Filter"" (opens the ""normal"" filters) or ""Hierachy levels""

** Sub-entries of ""Hierachy levels"": ""All levels"" (default), ""Only level 1"", ""Level 1-2"" and so on (see Landscape Diagram)"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	04/Jun/16 3:23 PM
