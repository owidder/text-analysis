Minify row count for multiple date intervals	"*Summary:*

Minify row count for multiple date intervals



*As-Is:*

* Every timespan-bar is in a new row



*To-Be:*

* The timespan-bars are in as less rows as possible, i.e. multiple bars are in one row if they do not overlap



*Implementation Details:*

* No url interaction

* Algorithm to stack bars for one element-row:

** Sort all bars by begin-date

*** If two bars have the same begin date, take the one first with smaller end date (= narrower)

*** i.e. Sorty by (start-date, end-date, name)

** Start in the first row with the ""first"" bar

** If the next bar fits right of any the previous bars (starting from top) (i.e. begin-date next bar > end-date any previous bar), add it to this row. Otherwise start a new row





*UI:*

* No legend

* No toolarea
