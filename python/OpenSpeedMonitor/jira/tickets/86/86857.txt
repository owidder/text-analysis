MM related cleanups	"Several things to do:

 * Promote the Boolean attribute type (currently used as ""Available to interfaces"") to an official custom attribute type.

 * IT Services are not translated in /icmm. Probably it is not correct in the Elastic. Correct this.

 * Remove all fixed/mandatory fields from all elements (besides name and description), convert them toÂ custom attributes. This applies to Status @ Information System, for example.

 * Clean up the special attribute ""Productive from / to"", convert it to two custom date attributes and one date interval."		New Feature	iteraplan Thunderduck	09/Jun/16 4:42 PM						cleanup	metamodel
