Update start/stop-scripts on Test-Server from SVN	"*IS:*

Start and Stop-scripts are deployed to the server manually on occasion.

Drawback: rollout is not automated and scripts are not under version control.



*SHOULD:*

* -checkin script files to SVN- already done in ITERAPLAN-4620, folder: {{iteraplan-9/infrastructure/e2e-test}}

* use scripts from SVN on the test server. (e.g. create a new Jenkins job that watches the specifc sub-directory in SVN and scp's the files to the test-server)"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	10/Jun/16 10:59 AM
