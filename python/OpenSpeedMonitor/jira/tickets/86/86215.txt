Refactoring of mpdDiagramBuilder	"Ideas from our discussion on Monday, 06th June:



*Goal:*

Break the mpdDiagramBuilder in smaller files



*Target structure:*

* Pipeline is unchanged, i.e. mpdGraphBuilder hands over all needed information to mpdDiagramBuilder (and *not* to any helper)

* mpdDiagramBuilder ""controls"" 3 subfiles:

** mpdTitleHelper

** mpdDataDiagramHelper

** mpdTimespanDiagramHelper

* mpdDiagramBuilder hands over needed information to helpers which create the separate diagrams (no interaction between helpers and any other file)

* Overaching functionality like ""drawDiagram"" and ""scrolling"" stays in the mpdDiagramBuilder

* All Code related to the title is extracted to mpdTitleHelper

* All Code related to the dataDiagram (left Side) is extracted to mpdDataDiagramHelper

* All Code related to the TimespanDiagram (right Side) is extracted to mpdTimespanDiagramHelper"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	03/Jun/16 11:17 AM	29/Jun/16 5:28 PM														28/Jun/16 9:00 PM;msr;Review completed.

I have updated implementation according to your review comments, but with



bq. Please extract all public functions out of the constructor



we are unable to use private variables like this: 

{code}



function MpdDiagramBuilder() {

    var privateVariable =...



    MpdDiagramBuilder.prototype.someMethod = function() {

        //here I can use privateVariable

    }

{code}"	29/Jun/16 5:28 PM;msr;Thank you for your ideas. As discussed: review is complete.
