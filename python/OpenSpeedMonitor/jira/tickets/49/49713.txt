Complete metamodel localization	"When loading the elastic metamodel, only for part of the elements (mostly types) are correct localized names assigned.

Make sure the localization is correct for relationships and predefined attributes (and their values) as well.



For this purpose, create a new resource bundle which contains localized names for all metamodel types, relationshipends and predefined properties.

This resource bundle is meant only for elastic metamodel localization.



Also change the already existing localization (using the classic resource bundle) to use this new resource bundle.



All user defined MM elements (properties, enum types and literals) have only _one_ name. This name is used as technical/persistent name and for all locales.



Customisations for customer are also in scope of this tickets."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	02/Jul/15 10:39 AM	30/Jul/15 3:45 PM					localization	metamodel
