Add translate provider and service and include for static texts	"Add module angular-translate.



Configure the translate provider with 

- static texts for everything BUT metamodel elements (including search for all static texts in the UI)

- the persistent name / localized name translations taken from the metamodel JSON



Replace all static texts with the new translate service for static texts.



The static non-MM texts are JSON files similar to Java resource bundles.

The MM translation is taken from a MM GET for each locale. So 2 GETs for DE and EN.



Keep in mind for the design, BUT do not implement yet:

A client should be able to add an extra resource file, for example for French.

The client should detect this locale and use it, when the user switches to this locale.



To be decided: in which layer is the translation:

- option 1: ui template uses translate directive or filter

- option 2: controller translates key from view model into value in scope

- option 3: view model already contains translated values

- opiton 4: a  combination of options above - NOT"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	03/Jul/15 11:29 AM	25/Aug/15 10:15 AM
