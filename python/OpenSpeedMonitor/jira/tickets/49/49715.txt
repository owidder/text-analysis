Consistently use localized metamodel names in interactive client	"Use translation service to display all metamodel element names in the localized form. Details see ticket on translation service.



Do not use the metamodel getName methods, and of course do not display getPersistentName. 

Use getPersistentName for all technical cases, for example as part of an URI that should work in all locales.



Remove all hard-coded name tables and similar, where possible.



After removing all getName and using the translation, remove the getName methods from the JS metamodel JSON wrapper."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	02/Jul/15 10:44 AM	15/Sep/15 5:15 PM					client	localization	metamodel
