NullPointerException in import for some permission configurations	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_
# Log into iteraplan with user ""system""
# Export Excel data
# Configure a role to have the permission for running Excel imports, and to *not* have read permission for BusinessObject
# Log out and log in with a user that has the aforementioned role
# Edit the Excel file to add a new Interface and InformationFlow
# Import the changed Excel file

_Expected:_ Interface and Information flow created, two Information Systems changed, no Business Object created, even if there was one added in the Excel File
_Actual:_ Everything as expected up to step 4. In step 5 there is a NullPointerException in {{InstanceCreator#createTransportIfApplicable}}, causing the import to abort.

_Reason:_ Due to the permission settings, the infomation flow structured type which the {{CreateDiff}} for the Information Flow refers to, does not know the relationship end to Business Objects.

_Solution:_ make the method null-safe.
Please also completely check the classes {{InstanceCreator}} and {{RelationshipSetter}} for other possible occurrences of this issue. Whenever a {{RSTE#findRelationshipEndByPersistentName}} or a {{metamodel#findStructuredTypeByPersistentName}} is performed, the possibility of a return value of ""null"" due to permission settings must be accounted for."
