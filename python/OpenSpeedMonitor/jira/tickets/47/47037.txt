Component/class for model data	"Write a JS class that holds the complete model data and gives specific access to it.
Working title for this class: ""Model"".

The class should be used as a Angular service by other services and controllers.

The contents of the class is initialized with a call to a service in the persistence layer, that in turn GETs the data from the REST API of the server.

The class has access methods to:
* get an element with a given ID.
* get elements of a given type (starting with IS, ISD, BO)
* ... and filtered by a given filter predicate
* .... and sorted by a sort order

The class has also method to 
* put back a modified element back to server. For this, it calls the underlying component from the persistence layer.
