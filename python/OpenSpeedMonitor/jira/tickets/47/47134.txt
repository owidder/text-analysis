Settings in title and/or legend	"*Summary:*
Add interactive settings in title and legend of the Nesting Cluster Diagram.

*As-Is:*
The settings of the Nesting Cluster Diagram are not shown in the diagram.

*To-Be:*
The following settings are shown in the Nesting Cluster Diagram:
* In the title: Outer element, inner element and last modification timestamp
* In the legend: Filtering, Grouping and Coloring
The user can delete or adapt the settings directly in the legend or title.

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Nesting Cluster Diagram
* Title
* Legend

*Approach:*
* The title should look like: ""Nested Cluster Diagram - "" + Outer Type + "" with supporting "" + Inner Type + ""s"" + "" ("" + last modification timestamp + "")"" , e.g.
Nested Cluster Diagram - Information System Domain with supporting Information Systems (20.11.2014 16:37h)
* The legend should look like:
Filter-Attribute ""="" Filter (e.g. Status = Current)
Inner Element Type ""grouped by"" Grouping-Attribute (e.g. Information Systems grouped by Successors)
""Colored by"" coloring-attribute (e.g. Colored by status) 
These lines are only shown, if an option is active (i.e. show only the filtering line, if any filtering is active).
* No highlighting or moving information is shown in the settings
* User interaction in title: The user can click on the outer element in the title and select a new outer element from the list outer elements. The diagram and the filters are updated accordingly.
* User interaction in title: The user can click on the inner element in the title and select a new inner element from the list outer elements. The diagram and the filters are updated accordingly.
* User interaction in legend: Each setting line in the legend shows an ""X"" symbol next to the setting to delete this setting.
* User interaction in legend: The user can select a new filtering-attribute and a new filter from a list of available attributes and filters. The diagram is updated accordingly.
* User interaction in legend: The user can select a new grouping-element and a grouping-attribute from a list of available elements and attributes. The diagram is updated accordingly.
* User interaction in legend: The user can select a new coloring-attribute from a list of available attributes. The diagram is updated accordingly.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user starts with the view of an open NCD with IS as inner elements.
The setting information (see above) is shown in the title.
The user actives a filtering by high complexity.
The ""last modification timestamp"" is updated immediately in the title and the ""Complexity = high"" -line is added to legend.
The user clicks on the word ""Complexity"" in the legend with primary click.
A list of available filter-attributes is shown immediately.
The user hovers over ""Status"".
A second level menu opens immediately on hover.
The user selects ""Current"".
The menu structure disappears.
The diagram is filtered immediately.
The settings in title (last modification timestamp) and legend are updated immediately.

The steps above must work with every setting and every update or delete action."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	04/Nov/14 8:40 AM	11/Feb/15 10:36 AM					legend									"23/Jan/15 11:07 AM;msr;timestamp = about current time in the local time zone (last time, when SVG was rendered)
