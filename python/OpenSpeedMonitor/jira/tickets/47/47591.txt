Cleanup "substFilter"	"Please cleanup ""substFilter"":

substFilter was replaced by filter.name during implementing text-filterings by all text attributes - code was not cleaned up everywhere because text-filtering story was not completed fully that moment.

Previously that variable was responcible for filtering inner elements by name from searchfield in context menu.
