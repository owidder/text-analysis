AND
reproduce if issue still exists

Menu not usable if not visible and no workaround because there is no ""scroll more to the right"" right of the legend.

Alex(or Andrew?) showed me a fix to his context menu that makes the menu show left of the click position if there is no horizontal space to the right of it.
Maybe this was only for the _second_ level submenu, and the first level context menu opens always to the right of the click.
But this should not be that hard for Alex."	15/Apr/15 1:24 PM;msr;First analyse and check, if workaround exists.	01/Jun/15 1:21 PM;sfe;Seems to have been fixed already
