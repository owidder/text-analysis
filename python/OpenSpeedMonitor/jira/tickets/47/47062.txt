Better error message in import special case: import of building block when a building block of another type with the same id already exists	"_Example (with sample data)_
# Download Excel template from iteraplan's Import/Export page
# Determine the ID of a business process in iteraplan's database (for example by opening the detail view and looking up the ID in the browser's address bar)
# Add a new line in the Excel template in the Information System sheet, entering the ID mentioned above in the ID cell and giving an arbitrary name and status value
# Import the Excel file with additive strategy

_Expected/good behaviour:_ During fourth import step (validate data) an error or warning message appears, stating that there already exists a building block with ID x.
_Actual:_ During fourth import step a general error message is displayed because an attempt was made to create an information system with an ID that already was present.

The expected behaviour could be produced by changing the matching algorithm during import as follows:
# Check whether there is an ObjectExpression in the database with same ID and type of the ObjectExpression to import (already done currently)
# If there is none with the same type and ID, check whether there is an ObjectExpression with the same ID, but a different type (not done currently)
# If there is an OE with same ID but different type, create a warning or error (still needs to be specified) and accordingly ignore that ObjectExpression or cancel the import"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	17/Oct/14 9:43 AM	26/Jan/15 10:11 AM					import	validation								"23/Jan/15 9:35 AM;tam;The most important code changes are:
