Information System list is displayed as empty	"A customer reports the following:
After some time of working with iteraplan, the list of information systems is displayed as empty. The information systems clearly still exist, as they can be access via spreadsheet reports or from relations of other elements.
The overview list of information systems, however, is displayed as empty, without any error messages.
Only Tomcat restart temporarily fixes the issue.

After some analysis and code review, the most likely cause is the following:
* An as of yet unidentified error triggers the exception handling in {{GuiSearchController}}
* {{GuiSearchController#handleIteraplanException}} is executed and sets an error flag to _true_. It then continues to perform various actions depending on the actual error.
* Instead of terminating normally, where the error flag would be set back to _false_, another Exception happens in this method.
* Thus the error flag permanently is set to _true_, which causes the information system list to be displayed as empty.

Solution for now: Make sure the error flag is always set back to _false_, no matter what happens during the exception handling."		Bug	iteraplan PO	10/Jun/15 4:26 PM	12/Jun/15 12:18 PM					exception
