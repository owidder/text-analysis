Hi Ingo,

bitte schreib in unsere Lizenzsammlung sowas wie 

Contains software copyrighted by Northwoods Software, http://www.nwoods.com

Kein Verweis auf go.js.

Wir brauchen ausdrücklich _nichts_ vorgegebenes in unserer Lizenz übernehmen. Siehe unten.
Ziemlich gechillt für eine US Firma.

Bitte nimm diese Mail zur Doku ins Ticket auf, vor allem Frage und Antwort von Fabian und Scott.

Merci
Wolfgang

Hi Fabian,

I neglected to answer your question regarding what you need to pass on to your customers in my previous email.

There's really nothing you need to pass on to your customers.  If you use and/or modify any of the GoJS sample code in your own product, you must maintain the copyright notices that are there.  Of course, you can also add your own copyright notices.

Kind regards,
Scott

Hi Jason,
 
thank you for sending the us the direct link to license terms. They are not really hard to find on the website, but somehow we did not see them …
 
Regarding the license only a single questions remains on our side: What do we have to pass on to our customers when we ship our product which then includes GoJS? Is it only the Copyrights notice “iteraplan includes the GoJS library copyried by …”
 
Concerning the quote, we didn’t realize so far that developers are licensed separately. This makes things a bit more complicated because of the price increase. Any way, we would need 3 developer licenses (for the same single product) and the multi domain option. Updates and support should be for 3 years.
 
Could you please send us an update of your offer- including all discounts available for our situation? Thank you very much.
 
Kind regards
Fabian

Hi Fabian,
 
Thank you for your inquiry.
 
Here is a link to our GoJS OEM pricing page: http://www.nwoods.com/store/p-82-gojs-oem.aspx and a link to our on-line click through license agreement is at the top. Today was a Holiday, so I apologize for the late reply. PDF of license: http://www.nwoods.com/sales/info/SoftwareLicenseAgreement.pdf
 
One developer license is good for a single developer to use GoJS, but if you require 2,3 or 4 developers, then we provide discounts of 12.5% at QTY 2, 16.7% at QTY 3 and 18.75% at QTY 4 and at QTY 4, we actually provide you unlimited developer's licenses.
 
Please let me know if you any other questions.
 
 
Kind Regards,
Jason

Hello Jason,
 
thank you for your quick response and for sending us the quote. So far GoJS looks very promising to us. Wolfgang told me that he’s already discussing technical details with the tech support on your side.
 
Could you please send us the exact license terms, so that we are able to finish our product evaluation? We’re especially interested in the terms we need to pass on to our customers.
Can you confirm that with the OEM/single application license an arbitrary number of developers can develop with GoJS?
 
Kind regards
Fabian

Hello Wolfgang,
 
Thank you for considering GoJS for your development needs. Regarding the licensing you would need, since you have one main product, then you would only require our single application licensee with our multi domain option. 
 
Attached is your quote. We can complete the order by receiving a PO from you for our quote, or you can also request a direct invoice by email. Our invoices are NET 30 and we can deliver the day you confirm the invoice/order.
 
Kind Regards,
Jason

Hello GoJs-Team,

we're currently evaluating the GoJS libraryfor use in our product.
Could you provide us the exact licensing terms for using GoJS? In our case we would need to include the library in our product (www.iteraplan.com), which is then distributed to customers worldwide and installed on their servers.

Moreover we will install the product locally on our servers for testing and evaluation purposes.
Also for evaluation and training, we have a variant that is installed on a single workstation and runs locally, that is in the localhost domain.

Best Regards
Wolfgang Frech
