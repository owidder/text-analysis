Actual: Black color of background
Expected: White background colour."		Bug	iteraplan PO	27/Feb/15 3:57 PM	08/Apr/15 5:21 PM														23/Mar/15 1:29 PM;msr;Maybe css-class is not transfered to pdf.	"03/Apr/15 2:55 PM;isc;The problem is, that jpeg (which we use as image in canvas) don’t support transparence. Therefor the background is black. background-color is not actually a part of canvas. So, two possible solutions exists:
# change the image type from jpeg to png
The Problem by this solution is, that all elements get a small gray boarder and the pdf doesn’t looks so good.
# draw a white rectangle in the same size like the image before drawing the SVG.

I implemented the second solution because it is the easiest is way.
