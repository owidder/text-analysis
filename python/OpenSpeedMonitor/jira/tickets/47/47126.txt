URL contains all view state	"Save all view state in URL, including highlight, exclusion, order of elements, with compact/encoded parameter

Solution for ordering of elements:
1. Save the initial ordering (at the moment only ""alphanumeric ascending"" - in the future may change)
2. Save all moves, which are done by the users, e.g. 2nd element two moves left, 5th element 3 moves right and so on

Compression will be discussed later. "		New Feature	iteraplan PO	04/Nov/14 8:24 AM	23/Dec/14 10:28 AM					url									17/Nov/14 5:05 PM;msr;-Order of elements shall not be included in the url. Reasoning behind: The url-length is fixed and the depending on the number of elements, this can be too much information. To-Do for Marcel: Inform WFR on Tuesday morning and re-check decision with him, if he agrees and shares my opinion.-	"18/Nov/14 9:28 AM;msr;After discussion with WFR and Andrii this morning, we found a solution to store the information of the ordering of elements. So, we decided to take the ordering in again.
Solution for now:
1. Save the initial ordering (at the moment only ""alphanumeric ascending"" - in the future may change)
2. Save all moves, which are done by the users, e.g. 2nd element two moves left, 5th element 3 moves right and so on

This solution does only work for a limited number of moves, but this is ok for now. We expect the user not to take too many moves now. But the solution should be robust for too many moves, i.e. if the user takes too many moves (more than the maximum storeable), the last moves are not saved, but all other. The diagram is *not* resetted (""Never lose my stuff"").

Compression will be discussed later. "
