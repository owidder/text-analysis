Adjust visualizations	"Make sure the changed relation works properly for Landscape Diagram, Cluster Diagram, Bar/Pie Diagrams and the Masterplan Diagram.
The attributes of the relation don't have to be available for reports, but the relation itself should work where available.
Adjust where necessary to make it work properly."	47165	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	04/Dec/14 1:59 PM	15/Dec/14 4:37 PM														"12/Dec/14 8:23 AM;isc;I discovered two problems:

# *Landscape Diagram*
I have selected as ""content"" IS and as ""column association"" IE. The filtering based only of the relationship but I would expect a filtering of IE. See also screenshot number 1
# *Bar/Pie Chart*
Content: IE
On the second configuration page -> in the box for “colour settings”:
* Choose in the first dropdown “Association”,
* in the second dropdown “IS”,
* In the third dropdown I missing the option “Number of assignments”.
