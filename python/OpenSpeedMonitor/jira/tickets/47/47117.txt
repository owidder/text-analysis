4 additional Building Block types as inner elements	"For the existing implemenation of the Nesting Cluster Diagram,
add the function to use the 4 additional types of building blocks as inner elements.

As-is: only IS as inner element.
To-be: The following building block types: 

* Business Object
* Information System (existing)
* Interface
* Technical Component
* Infrastructure Element


UI

In the list of elements view, the action ""as Nesting Cluster Diagram"" is unchanged,
but it works for above building block types, list see above.

In the NCD view, add actions (in context menu and in menu bar) to switch to a different building block type for the inner element.


Diagram

Structure of the diagram unchanged, but different content:

Behavior

If the user switches the inner element type from X to Y in a Nesting Cluster DIagram with outer element type Z, and if Z is connected to Y, then Z is used for the new NCD. The user may change Z later. 
If Z is not connected, the default outer type for Y is used in the NCD, just as coming form a list view of type Y.

The list of default outer types for inner types will be defined at the beginning of development.
Default outer types for inner types:
* Inner type: Business Object - Outer type: Information System
* Inner type: Information System (existing) - Outer type: Information System Domain
* Inner type: Interface - Outer type: Information System
* Inner type: Technical Component - Outer type: Information System
* Inner type: Infrastructure Element - Outer type: Information System

Acceptance criteria:

In the item list view of Technical Components, the user can click the action ""As NCD"", and the system displays a NCD with the TCs from the list, grouped by IEs.

More general, the user can do this for every list of elements. 

In a NCD, the user can click an action ""use Interfaces as inner elements"", and the diagram updates accordingly.

More general: in every NCD with inner element type X, the user can switch to any other element type Y.

For each type T, the NCD will have the specified default outer type intially.

When switching the inner type, the outer type is unchanged if it is connected to the new inner type.

The solution uses the metamodel information from the REST API."
