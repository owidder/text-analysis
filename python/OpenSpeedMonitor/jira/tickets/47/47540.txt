NCD: Text lenght (text input bar for filtering by text properties)	"Summary: Uncorrect seraching behavior with several keywords in the Text input bar

Steps to reproduce: 
1. Go to NCD (ISD+IS)
2. Use filter by ""Description"" text properties for inner elements
3. Enter ""Account management system for * check accounts * savings accounts * money market accounts in the **regional** branch status"" in the Text input bar
4. Click on ""Search"" button
Actual: Empty diagram
Expected: Should be displayed  ""Account-Sys RB # 3.1"" 

Comment: Maybe better to add  lenght validation for text?

analyze

first idea: this has to do with multiline text and line breaks
so searching needs a kind of normal form of both item values and search value

test case is valid, but somewhat atypical. 
I expect users to search for single words in the description, not for whole multiline sections."
