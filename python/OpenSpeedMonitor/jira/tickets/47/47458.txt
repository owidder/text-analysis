Create static legend for IS/ISD/TC 	"Create a static legend for the static settings IS/ISD/TC/no filters, no coloring.

Legend can be a static  but in the same place as the real legend later, that is a seperate div-element or canvas, that is an extra go.js diagram (with static content).

no user interaction with that legend.

pretty (final) look.

use go.js for that as well, but as a second diagram, and that diagram is drawn to a second div element in the template.

The class for drawing the legend should be an extra class, not part of the table builder."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	03/Mar/15 4:17 PM	24/Mar/15 1:02 PM														"10/Mar/15 3:59 PM;wfr;Risk: Can two divs with two go.js diagram canvases be drawn side by side, horizontally?

We don't need it, right?

not all jsdocs clear: what are params and return value types

 What could be the * as return? Why?

 More JsDocs e.g. for properties and methods within it and also for parts within methods why this or that implemented like this, but not for simple getters and setters"
