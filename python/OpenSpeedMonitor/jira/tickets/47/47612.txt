Add new client to installer package	"_as-is:_ New client is installed manually side by side with the iteraplan server (which includes the classic client)

_to-be:_ New client (that is its {{index.html}} and other resources) is part of the overall web client served by one installed webapp only.
No extra webapp for the new client.

New client entry point moves one level down to:
{{.../<context name, if any>/client/index.html}}

Note that ""client"" is not used for the classic client nor the REST API.

For the installation package, copy the new client's resources to the respective position in the web content folder.

If no easy automatic solution can be found, for the initial release a manual copy step is ok.

It needs to be added into the folder ""application"" inside the jar file.
It will then be installed correctly during the installation procedure of iteraplan."
