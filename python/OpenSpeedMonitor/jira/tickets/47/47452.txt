Empty diagram with path connection by default (IE+Interface)	"Steps to reproduce: 
1. Use Infrastructure Element as outer type and Interface as inner type

Actual: an empty diagram appears for the default path connection
Expected: Is this a correct result?

Analyse and if necessary, please fix it.
If the result is correct, you may change the default path?"		Bug	iteraplan PO	02/Mar/15 9:57 AM	13/Apr/15 8:24 AM														"08/Apr/15 10:21 AM;nle;1) There are no Interface as inner type for Infrastructure Element as outer type. So the digram should be empty (in contrast to the old client!).
2) The ticket ITERAPLAN-3016 creates a message, that is shown, if an empty diagram was built.
3) Since there is no technical sorting of the paths, so there is no simple method to change the paths. "
