Name legends in visualizations: move index number to the front of the label	"If a label in a visualization is too long and the use of name legends is activated, the label will be shorted and a number index added to refer to the name legend entry.

Currently, this index is added to the end of the shortened label.
In extreme cases this results in unreadable index numbers.

Please move the index number to the front of the label, to avoid this issue"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	13/Jan/15 1:09 PM	13/Jan/15 2:00 PM					visualization									13/Jan/15 2:00 PM;gph;Looks good.
