Nesting for same building block type: "level-slider"	"*Summary:*
Adapt the nesting for same building block type: Create a ""level-slider"" (see attached mock-up) for the levels of nesting.

*As-Is:*
Nesting for same building block type always starts with the highest level of hierarchy and goes up to 4 levels of hierarchy.

*To-Be:*
The levels for nesting can be chosen individually.

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Nested cluster diagram

*Approach:* 
For the same building block type, e.g. Information System as inner and outer element, create a special case: If the user selects both types same, a newly created ""level slider"" (see attached mock-up) immediately appears on the position as the filter-slider. The user selects the levels of hierarchy, i.e. a hierarchy starting level and a hierarchy ending level (default is level 1 to 3 selected). The diagram gets updated immediately. The hierarchy starting level is level for the outer elements, the other levels are the inner elements. 
*The grouping and path-selection is deactivated in this special case.*
All other options (e.g. filtering, coloring, highlighting, etc.) work as expected.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
A Nested Cluster Diagram is open.
The user selects Information Systems as inner and outer type.
 A ""level slider"" immediately appears. 
Level 1 to 3 is default selected.
The user selects Level 2 as starting level.
The outer Information Systems are now the second level of hierarchy.
The user selects Level 6 as ending level.
The diagram is updated immediately, i.e. the levels 3-6 are shown as inner elements.
The level-slider disappears with any other action, e.g. click.
The grouping and path-selection is deactivated.

This works for any building block type, coloring, filtering, highlighting, etc.
