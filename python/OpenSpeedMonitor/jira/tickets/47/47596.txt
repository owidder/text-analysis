Computation of border line type	"Implement the computation for border line types of content elements (e.g. in class ""ItemDecorator"").

There should be 5 different line types:

* small: small line strength, small size of dash and small size of distance between dashes (looks like dotted)
* small-medium: still small line strength, still small size of dash and bigger distance between dashes (looks like dotted with more spaces)
* medium: medium line strength, medium size of dash and medium distance between dashes (looks like dashed)
* medium-big: medium line strength, medium size of dash and bigger distance between dashes (looks like dashed with more spaces)
* big: solid line"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	09/Apr/15 5:02 PM	23/Apr/15 6:46 AM														"09/Apr/15 5:02 PM;msr;
*Summary:*
Implement different border line types for inner elements, which depend on a enumeration or numeric attribute (analogue mechanism to coloring).

*As-Is:*
There exists only one solid border line for inner elements.

*To-Be:*
Border lines can be specifically selected by enumeration or numeric attribute.

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Landscape Diagram inner boxes
* Legend
* Url
* Context menu

*Approach:* 
Analogue to the coloring mechanism implement a mechanism for border line types (solid, dotted, ...) of inner boxes.
The new context menu is named ""Line type by enumeration property"" and ""Line type by numeric property"".
Adapt the legend and url accordingly.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user has the same options as in the coloring of inner elements, i.e. analogue context menu actions, analogue legend, analogue url, ..."	16/Apr/15 11:11 AM;msr;Please don't use 5 fixed line types, but try to calculate them dynamically by the number of values (e.g. 8 enumeration values mean 8 different line types). Please try to design an algorithm for that.

Small notes.
- We have 5 base lines style profiles (based on described in IPNINE-458), look for baseProfiles array.
- If number of required elements more than 5 the method uses the same profiles but with increased lines/strokes width. Additionally lengths and distances between strokes increases appropriately to line width."	22/Apr/15 4:49 PM;tam;See comments to IPNINE-458
