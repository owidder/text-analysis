{color:red}
*Addition to this ticket:*
Add the new context menu (3-level-menu and on the first level ""Show with ..."" of IPNINE-226 in this ticket. Please see mockups of IPNINE-226 .

*Summary:*
Create a filter on elements for inner boxes of the Nesting Cluster Diagram. Filter options are *numeric attributes* of the elements. Filters must be implemented for all available *numeric* parameters

*As-Is:*
Inner Boxes can be filtered by status, complexity and last modification date.

*To-Be:*
Inner Boxes can be filtered by all available *numeric* attributes.

*Affected parts of the system:*
- Nesting cluster diagram
- context menu
- action bar near context menu (new)

*Approach:* 
The values can be text type, enumeration (like in status), dates (like in ""last modification date) or numeric (like in costs). For this ticket only numeric attributes are in scope. The other 3 types follow in follow-up tickets. The numeric type uses new ""range picker"" with open end in a new ""action bar"" ""near"" the context menu (to be created)

Adapt context menu: Use new ""range picker"" to select lower and upper bound for the numeric filtering (see attached mockup). This mockup informs about positioning and content, it is no styleguide for the layout. Leave the current layout as is.

Special-case: Multi-value attributes: If an attribute has multiple values, this is not an issue for the simple filtering. If any of the values matches the filtering, then the other values can be ignored.

The solution uses the metamodel information from the REST API.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user starts with the view of an open NCD with IS as inner elements.
The user opens the context menu for inner boxes with secondary click. 
In the menu, he hover over ""Show with ..."" (Note: with ellipsis ""...""). 
A second level menu opens immediately on hover. 
The user clicks on ""Costs"" with primary click.
An action bar opens immediately on hover.
The user selects a lower numeric bound by dragging the lower boundary.
The lower limit (i.e. number) is updated immediately.
The diagram is filtered immediately.
The user selects an upper numeric bound by dragging the upper boundary.
The upper limit (i.e. number) is updated immediately.
The diagram is filtered immediately.
The users does a primary click next to menu structure.
The menu structure (incl. action bar) disappears.

The steps above must work with every *numeric* attribute defined for all building block types available for the inner boxes.
The steps must work starting with no filtering by attribute, or starting with an existing filtering by attribute.



"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	24/Nov/14 2:33 PM	11/Feb/15 11:04 AM					context	filtering	nesting							"12/Jan/15 1:37 PM;wfr;1) implement only the actions in the context menu, but not (yet) the actions in the menu/action bar.
Reason: the action bar concept is not ready now.

adding the actions to the menu/action bar will be done in an extra ticket later.


2) use a stack of two simple sliders instead of a range slider with two thumbs.

Reason: simple sliders are available (html5), and complex slider is not, would require bootstrap.js, jquery.js or reimplementation.

"	"23/Jan/15 8:36 AM;msr;1. Yes, the context menu should disappear, when user selects any filtering attribute. (Good idea) And the range slider/text input bar/date picker should appear immediately after selection of a filtering attribute. And they should all be on the same position in the screen.
2. Yes, the range slider/text input bar/date picker should show the last used data, only if this filter is active. The can change the active filter.
3. The range slider/text input bar/date picker appears only after selection of a filtering attribute. And it disappears with any other action."
