EMF-Import: Business Mapping not deleted on EMF-import when part of Business Mapping missing	"After deleting a part of a existing Business Mapping (e.g. Information System Release) and importing via EMF-Import as overwrite, the adapted Business Mapping should be deleted as it is incomplete. But no changes are applied.

REPRODUCE:
- Export full model as XMI
- Edit iteraplan.xmi: Delete an InformationSystemRelease for any Business Mapping
- Import this changed data with overwrite-strategy
- ""No Changes"" are applied

SHOULD:
The adapted Business Mapping should be deleted as it is incorrect (missing Information System Release). "		Bug	iteraplan PO	28/Oct/14 4:31 PM	29/Oct/14 2:01 PM					emf	import	xmi							"29/Oct/14 1:39 PM;sfe;This works as expected if the XMI file is changed correctly: Not only the Business Mapping object has to be modified. The formerly referenced Information System needs to be adjusted, to remove the reference to the Business Mapping here as well.
I've adjusted the test sheet to make this more clear."
