Cluster diagram shows wrong subordinate elements (only for BBT Project)	"Reproduce:
* Go to cluster diagram configuration page
* Select all elements and proceed
* On 2nd page: Generate diagram with checkbox ""Subordinate Projects"" activated

Expected:
The child elements are shown in the row for subordinate projects

Actual:
The parent element (superordinate project) is shown instead.


This behavior seems to occur for Building Block Type ""Project"" only.
