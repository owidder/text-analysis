New Client: Create login screen	"*Summary:*
Create a login screen for the new client and protect all other pages behind this login.

*As-Is:*
There exists no login.

*To-Be:*
All users can log in the new client with their existing accounts of the classic iteraplan.

*Affected parts of the system:*
New client:
* Login screen (to be created)
* All other pages (protected behind the login screen)

*Approach:*
The screen should be made with small effort, e.g. a copy of the classic iteraplan login screen (logo, version, username, password, login-button).

If you have any questions, please contact WFR or MSR.

*Unsorted Notes*
* Option: the login on the new JS client initiates a Java Servlet session
* Option: the login saves user name and password and accesses the REST API with these credentials, without session.
* Open: do we have to protect the client _code_ against unauthenticated acccess (strongest option), or only _using_ the clilent, or only using the client with _data_ (weakset option)? 
* Option: access to the new client redirects to a classic server-based login page and redirects back to the orginal index.html. Cave: the complete URI including the query parameters, so that the deep links work. 
"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	20/Jan/15 10:36 AM	30/Dec/15 11:58 AM					login	newClient								"09/Feb/15 3:47 PM;wfr;Discussion on estimation:

Scenario: User has no (valid) session in the iteraplan server and starts new client.


Before: user has no valid session, either no session at all, or only a servlet session but not a successful login, or no valid session after timeout.

(1) user navigates to a view in the new client, either home view or any other (deep linked) view.

(2) new client initalizes and requests metamodel data from server

(3) server responds with error code

(4) new client redirects itself to the start screen of classic client.

(5) from here, redirection, login, redirection to classic start screen

(6) user clicks (static) link to new client

(7) new client re-initializes, this time succesful

(8) optional: if user wanted to go to a deep linked view: user clicks original link again, or pastes original address again.

(9) new client displays view

Note 1: static link from classic start screen to new client home screen already in place.

Note 2: no automatic re-redirection back to original target view in new client.

Note 3: no extra ""do I have a valid session"" request, test is implicit in the first access, here metamodel."
