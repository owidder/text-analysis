Informationsystem Releases without Version sometimes cannot be saved	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_
# Open Information System ""CRM # 3.1""
# Edit -> clear the version field
# Save

_Expected:_ Changes are successfully saved
_Actual:_ Error message ""An element of this type with the release identification CRM already exists."" appears and element cannot be saved.

This happens whenever an Information System has 2 or more releases and you try to save one of those with empty version field, even if it is the only release of this particular Information System with empty version.

Issue may possibly exist for Technical Component Releases, too."		Bug	iteraplan PO	08/Dec/14 11:11 AM	15/Dec/14 11:19 AM					release
