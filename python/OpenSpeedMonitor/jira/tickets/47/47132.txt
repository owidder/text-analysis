SVG to PDF rendering	"+++++++++++++++++
POSTPONED AFTER APRIL 2015
+++++++++++++++++
Base the PDF on the vector format, so that magnified PDF has no visible pixels.

For the demo-prototype in October a quick technical solution was necessary and fine. For the long term a strategical solution must be found.
As-Is: Via a library the svg-format is transferred to a png/jpeg and then to a pdf. Therefore the pdf-graphics are based on pixels and not on vectors (as within the svg).

To-Be: Find a new way (e.g. a new library) to directly export vector graphics from svg to pdf. The vector based pdf is then scalable and can be printed out on papers with big format.
