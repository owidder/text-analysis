Space in "add relationship" must show all candidates	"When the user searches for elements add to a list of connected elements, he must have a way to see the full list of all candidates.
Candidates are all elements not yet connected.

As-is: the user can enter a search string, and the system shows a list of all matching elements.

To-be: when the user enters a space character, the system shows the full list.

Note: as the search string should be trimmed in any case, the trimmed space is the empty string, which is ""part of"" any element name.
