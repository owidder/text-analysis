Selective Elastic Model Validation	"Currently on each REST PUT or POST and each import the whole elastic model is validated, regardless of the amount of actual changes.

This can be improved by providing the ModelDiff object to the model validators and let them decide, based on the diffs, which part of the model they need to validate.

Examples:
* Unique constraint validator needs to validate all object expressions of a type where there was at least one change in a property with the ""unique"" flag. Validation doesn't need to be done for all other types.
* Cardinality constraint validation only needs to be done for those object expressions where feature values/assignments were changed, and only for those changed features."
