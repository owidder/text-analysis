Sprint 6? Grouping by Business Mapping (concrete)	"This story completes the story IPNINE-205 .

*Summary:*
To the existing NCD, add the function to use the connections via Business Mapping of Information System to Business Process, Business Unit and Product for grouping.

*As-Is:*
Direct or 2-step-connections are implemented for grouping.

*To-Be:*
Direct, 2-step-connections or connections via Business Mapping for of Information System to Business Process, Business Unit and Product are implemented for grouping.

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Nesting Cluster Diagram
* Inner Elements

*Approach:*
Use a generic solution that uses the metamodel information for
* determining the connections for a given inner building block type
* access the model data for the connected elements and/or the grouping structure.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user starts with the view of an open NCD with IS as inner elements.
The user opens the context menu for inner boxes with secondary click. 
The user hovers over ""Group elements"".
A second level menu opens immediately on hover.
The users clicks on ""Business Processes"" with primary click.
The menu structure disappears.
The diagram is filtered immediately.

The steps above must work for BU, BP and P for IS. The steps above must work independently of any grouping before or not.
