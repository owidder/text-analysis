sketch a diagram on the solution, present it to all developers.

will do."	"12/Mar/15 3:31 PM;wfr;solution idea for this ticket:

* lsdMainClass configures all stages of the pipeline, including dataService and itemBuilder
* lsdMainClass gets fields from the lsdConfiguration and calls a method configure with these values, for each stage of the pipeline
* each stage of the pipeline stores these in private fields.
* a stage of the pipeline, including dataService, must not have a back-reference to mainClass or a cross-reference to configuration. If so, it will be removed
* the data service uses the type names to read the business objects (data model elements) for each type
* unchanged: the dataService uses the dataModel as an injected dependency.
 

idea for tiny steps, maybe to small:
1) in dataService , add fields for configuration parts (type names) 
2) in dataService , add method configure
3) in mainClass, call configure
4) in dataService , use new fields instead of configuration
5) in dataService and mainClass, remove injection of configuration (now unused parameter)"	"24/Mar/15 8:33 AM;msr;*lsdconfiguration.js:

Could you please add a unit-test for the method ""getMetaTypeDefinitionByTypeName"" of lsdconfiguration.js"
