Checkpoint/Reference -- All Building Block types as inner elements	"*Summary:*
Implement all Building Block types as inner elements.

*As-Is:*
Only Information Systems exists as inner element.

*To-Be:*
All Building Block types can be selected as inner elements.

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Landscape diagram

*Approach:* 
The building block type of the inner elements can be changed via the context menu entry ""Change inner element"" (to be created). If the axis-elements are directly connected to the inner element, the axis-elements remain unchanged. If one of the axis-element is not connected to the inner element, use the default axis-elements:

* -(1) Inner element: Information System, Axis elements: Technical Component, Infrastructure Element-
* (2) Inner element: Technical Component , Axis elements: Information System, Infrastructure Element
* (3) Inner element: Infrastructure Element , Axis elements: Information System, Technical Component
* -(4) Inner element: Interface , Axis elements: Information System, Business Object-
   -Caution: spec uses ""classic schema"", not ""elastic metamodel""; interface has no direct connection to IS-
   -corrected to: Interface by Flow and TC-
* (5) Inner element: Business Object , Axis elements: Information System, Business Domain
* (6) Inner element: Business Function , Axis elements: Information System, Business Object
* (7) Inner element: Business Domain , Axis elements: Business Object, Business Process
* (8) Inner element: Business Process , Axis elements: Business Domain, Information System
* (9) Inner element: Business Unit , Axis elements: Business Domain, Information System
* (10) Inner element: Product , Axis elements: Business Domain, Information System   

Numbers (1) to (10) for reference in tests. Do not change this numbering.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user opens the landscape diagram with Information System as inner and Technical Component and Infrastructure Elements as axis elements.
The user uses secondary click on an Information System.
The context menu opens immediately.
The user selects ""Change inner element"".
All Building Block types (except for Architectural Domain, Information System Domain and Project) are offered in a second level context menu.
The user selects Business Object.
The context menu disappears immediately and the diagram is updated accordingly.

This works for all possible inner elements independently of any filtering, coloring, etc.
