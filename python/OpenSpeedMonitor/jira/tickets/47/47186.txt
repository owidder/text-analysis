Target browser check and minor fixes	"The new iteraplan client must run on Firefox and Internet Explorer.

*Requirements*
All functions of the client must run on
* FF 26 (one year old)
* FF 33.1.1 (current)
* IE 11
* IE 12
* Chrome (current)

*Approach*
Three phases: 

1) Check the existing client if it works on 
and document in this ticket comment.

2) Analyse problems, if any, classify into minor and major fixes, and document in this ticket.

3) Fix minor problems immediately, that is in the scope of this ticket.
Defer any larger issues, for example replacement of a library, or cross cutting rework on many source files.
Note: Major fixes are *not* in the scope of this ticket.

*Background*
Chrome is an excellent development platform, but not a target platform.
Both Firefox and Internet Explorer are more important or widespread than Chrome for the organizations that use iteraplan.
IE and FF are officially supported by iteraplan (classic), and iteratec is bound by the license contracts to support them.

*Acceptance Criteria*
For the scope of this ticket:

The new client runs on all target browsers with all currently implemented features.

OR

When running the client on all target browsers, only documented problems occur.
AND
There is a list of remaining problems and intended fixes.
AND
The development team and the PO understand these list.
AND
All minor issues are already fixed.

In the run of the next 2-3 sprints: running on all target browsers without remaining issues."
