Edit coloring property value in-place in diagram	"In the existing nesting cluster diagram, add editing to the property that is currently used for coloring.

For example, if complexity is used for coloring, the context menu has an additional entry 
* Change complexity to
** high
** medium
** low
** no value

The sub-entries for the value should have background color as the boxes with that value.

Same for status.

If the coloring is by a numeric value, for example Cost, the context menu should have an entry with a text field. 
When the user edits the text field, the box changes its color on change (not on blur). The textfield itself is not color coded.

Same for Strategic Value.
