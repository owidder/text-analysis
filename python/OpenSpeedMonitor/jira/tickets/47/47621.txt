Continuous elastic update works inconsistently with large transactions	"_Reproduce (using sample data):_
# Download complete Excel data and save the file.
# Download empty Excel template and save the file.
# Import empty Excel template with overwrite strategy to delete all building blocks
# Import complete Excel data file

_Expected:_ Import successful, elastic model completely updated.

_Actual:_ The import finishes successfully, but the elastic model is corrupted. Can be checked by downloading Excel data again: Sheets for relationship types are filled incompletely; Invalid Business Mappings and only partially assigned Associations can be seen.

_Why?_
The order in which the continuous elastic update handles the hibernate events from the import leads to some changes reverting parts of originally fully constructed association objects.

_Solution:_
Perform the updates in the right order."
