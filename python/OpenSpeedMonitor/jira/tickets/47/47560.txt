Logging of unsuccessful login attempts	"Currently each successful login attempt is logged in a special logfile by {{UserContextInitializationService}}.
Unsuccessful login attempts are not logged.

Please add logging of unsuccessful login attempts into the same file.
_Possible implementation:_
Extend or wrap spring security's {{ExceptionMappingAuthenticationFailureHandler}} to add the logging functionality to the method {{#onAuthenticationFailure}} and use the new implementation as failure handler in the spring security configuration."
