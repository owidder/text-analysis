Datepicker doesn't work for adjacent, greyed out dates	"When you click on a date field (for example IS ""from"") and select a greyed out date from an adjacent month, then the inserted date value will most likely be wrong.

Example: Go to ""January 2015"" and select the 31rd of december 2014.

The datepicker plugin is not maintained any longer, and there are no updates according to:
https://github.com/Aymkdn/Datepicker-for-Bootstrap

This page points to and recommends another implementation:
https://github.com/eternicode/bootstrap-datepicker

This could be an alternative (maybe with the new client).
