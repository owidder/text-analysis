Migration scripts for IS-IE relation in saved Nesting Cluster Diagrams are incomplete	"With the changes to the IS-IE relation to allow for attributes, the saved nesting cluster reports involving this relation have to be migrated.

One possible case, when the IS-IE relation is *not* the first step in the path from outer to inner type, was already included in the migration scripts.
Example:
NCD with BusinessObject as outer type and InfrastructureElement as inner type.
Saved relation between the two types:
* formerly: {{/informationSystemReleases/infrastructureElements}}
* now: {{/informationSystemReleases/infrastructureElementAssociations/infrastructureElement}}

The other case is, when the IS-IE relation *is* the first step in the relation path.
Example:
NCD with InfrastructureElement as outer type and InformationSystem as inner type.
Saved relation between the two types:
* formerly: {{/informationSystemReleases}}
* now: {{/informationSystemReleaseAssociations/informationSystem}}

The issue here is, that the relation path does not contain information about the outer type. So a plain replacement of all occurences of ""/informationSystemReleases"" will also replace unchanged relations like the one from Project to InformationSystem.

Idea: Add additional update statements for this case, and query the outer type in the SQL update statement's where clause:
{noformat}
... where CONTENT like '%<entry key=""outer"" value=""InfrastructureElement""/>%';
{noformat}
(Syntax may not be entirely correct, but it should be possible in a similar manner)

Also ensure that /informationSystemReleases and /infrastructureElements are only replaced at the beginning of the relationship path."
