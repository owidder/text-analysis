Wrong behaviour of colorpicker in NCD	"*how to reproduce:*
- go to NCD in the new client
- set any coloring by numeric properties (e.g. by strategic value from red to green)
- pick a new color for ""Parameter is null or undefined""

*expected:*
  only coloring for undefined parameter changes (coloring min->max stay red to green)
*actual:*
  whole coloring min->max changes to _white_ to green"		Bug	iteraplan PO	08/May/15 11:12 AM	11/May/15 10:29 AM					Coloring	NCD								11/May/15 10:29 AM;tam;fixed
