* *queryProcessor.js*
please comment / jsdoc it, because now it's complicated to understand code at the first view and comments would help
jsdoc for the class
comments for the methods within it

* *controller.lsd.js*
1.
maybe separate scope variables and scope methods for better readability?
scope variables first, scope methods then
2. 
does it make sense to create an init block and so separate the declaration and initialization? also for better readability
3.
comment / jsdoc some scope variables => lsd

* *LSDConfiguration.js*
why do we need the default private variable? can't we just use this.defaults?

* *common.js*
please comment the getAlias and getParamName within factory('queryAliasHandler'
it will help every developer in the future to understand what they are for, why they implemented so
for example: why we are doing this conversion
_return String.fromCharCode(A + (aliasValue / N | 0)) + aliasValue % N;_
or why we are using the second condition here:
_if(!paramPosition || (alias.charCodeAt(0)-A) < 0) {_

please jsdoc and comment it"	"07/Apr/15 4:49 PM;sepr;{quote}

{quote}
yes we need it. To make impossible not controlled modifications of parameters.
You should use only set() / get() methods - and we will be able to avoid writing incorrect data etc.
both methods allow to work with one parameter and with an params-object too."
