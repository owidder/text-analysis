More diagram file formats	"For existing (nesting cluster) and future diagrams, add more export file formats to the client.

Exisitng: 
 * SVG (non-interactive variant of diagram view)
 * PDF (preliminary)
 * PNG (internal only)

To be:
 * SVG with links back to diagram and elements in interactive client
 * PDF as scalable/vector format, not based on PNG
 * PNG external too
 * JPEG (less important)
 * Visio (only modern 2012? format, not older)

Visio is open to discussion on feasability.

PNG/JPEG/PDF should be rendered with a SVG to library."		Epic	iteraplan PO	03/Nov/14 3:26 PM	30/Dec/15 12:03 PM														"07/Nov/14 3:50 PM;sepr;RE ~50 SP without Visio.
