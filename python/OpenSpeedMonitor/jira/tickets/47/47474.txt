I tried to understand {code}var drawFilters = function (area){code} but I couldn't. Maybe because I don't know goJs.
Please add comments to some steps within this function (e.g. what is area, what is partOf, why do we need copy of partOf, what's happen within foreach and why? ...)
The function is too long. Is it possible to refactore it?

*lsdTableModelBuilder.js*
{code}var showFilteringOptions = function(filterType, filters, modelProperty){code}
this function came indirectly from this ticket. please adjust code formating and add some comments. if possible, refactore it
