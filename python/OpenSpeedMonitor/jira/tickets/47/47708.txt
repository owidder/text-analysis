In IE  (date range) filter for "last modification Time" doesn’t work	"*Reproduce:*
# open an NCD
# use the filter “Show with date properties” -> “letzte Änderung”
# submit a date range

*Expected result:*
you get an reduced result of elements

*Actual in IE:*
no elements where found

For other date properties the filter seems to work.
