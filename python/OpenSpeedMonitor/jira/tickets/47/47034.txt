Unexpected behavior during imports	"The following steps are made:

# Download all Information Systems (partial download)
# Select the downloaded file for upload without changing it. Strategy “additive”.
# Upload the file

Expected behavior: the file is imported (uploaded) successfully. 

Actual behavior: the import fails sometimes, sometimes it’s successful. The error message is “Import process terminated with errors. No changes were made to the database.” Especially a repeated import of the same file seems to cause errors.

The behavior has to be tested with other strategies as well. 

------
May be fixed already in ITERAPLAN-2783, but please verify.
