User defined colours for enumeration	"*Requested by B-108 and FKA:*

*Summary:*
Add user-defined colours for enumerations and add to url

*As-Is:*
Colouring of attributes cannot be changed by the user.

*To-Be:*
The user can change the colouring of enumeration attributes directly in the diagram. No validation necessary (double colours allowed).

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Nesting Cluster Diagram
* Inner Elements
* Outer Elements
* Colouring legend

*Approach:*
Use a colour picker directly in the colouring legend to change the colouring. The user can select the colours for all enumeration entries.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user starts with the view of an open NCD with IS as inner elements and ISD as outer elements. Colouring by status is activated.
The user clicks with primary click on the colouring legend on the colour for ""Target"".
A colour picker windows opens immediately.
The users selects a colour with primary click.
The colour picker window disappears immediately.
The diagram is updated immediately: The colouring legend and all boxes with ""Target"" parameter are newly coloured.
When another user uses the same url, the diagram is colored the same.

The steps above must work for all colours and all enumeration attributes.

The user defines a custom coloring for an attribute like type of status. After choosing the coloring for another attribute like state of health, all specific user-defined colours for type of status are lost. When he selects again type of status the colouring is again default.
The same applies for navigating to any other page. Again all user-defined colouring is lost.
BUT the information of user-specific colouring is encoded in the url. So the only possibility to ""save"" the colouring is to bookmark the url."	"21/Jan/15 1:49 PM;msr;2nd update by MSR in discussion with Andrii & Daria:

Changing outer element cancels outer-element-options, but inner element stays coloured (if still connected).
