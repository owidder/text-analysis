Add an option to write content text in vertical text	"To the existing LSD, add the option to write the text of the content element vertically.

This feature is meant to be used together with vertical spanning, or in a diagram with many columns.

In the classic client, the column headers are still horizontal, and the colums still have their default width, so that we see vertical text in a landscape cell, which does not fit.

If this feature is included in the new client, the problem above has to be fixed, for example by turning the column titles, too, and making column widths computed, or narrower.
