Sprint 6? Connections and (connected) types: 1-step	"To the existing NCD,
add the function to use all connections to other building block types for grouping.

Use a generic solution that uses the metamodel information for
* determining the connections for a given inner building block type
* access the model data for the connected elements and/or the grouping structure.

Make only direct connections to the items listed in IPNINE-204 (not connections via 2-steps or Business Mapping). See:
