Sprint 6? Grouping by Business Mapping (abstract)	"{color:red}*To-Do Iteratec: Complete list of connections*{color}
This story completes the story IPNINE-205 and IPININE-236 .

*Summary:*
To the existing NCD, add the function to use all connections to other building block types for grouping.

*As-Is:*
Direct or 2-step-connections and the Business Mapping from IS to BP, BU, P are implemented for grouping.

*To-Be:*
Direct, 2-step-connections or connections via Business Mapping for all Building Block Types are implemented for grouping. The list of connections is stated below.

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Nesting Cluster Diagram
* Inner Elements

*Approach:*
Use a generic solution that uses the metamodel information for
* determining the connections for a given inner building block type
* access the model data for the connected elements and/or the grouping structure.

List of connections:
From Business Domain:
* BP
* BU
* Prod
* BO

From BP:
* BD
* BU
* Prod
* IS

From BU
* BD
* BP
* Prod
* IS

From Prod
* BD
* BP
* BU
* IS

From 
...

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user starts with the view of an open NCD with IS as inner elements.
The user opens the context menu for inner boxes with secondary click. 
The user hovers over ""Group elements"".
A second level menu opens immediately on hover.
The users clicks on ""Business Processes"" with primary click.
The menu structure disappears.
The diagram is filtered immediately.

The steps above must work for any connection via Business-Mapping. The steps above must work independently of any grouping before or not.
