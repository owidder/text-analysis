An empty diagram with filtering for axis	"Summary: Some times when user uses filtering by self-related for axis - we haven't items for displaying and  we get an empty diagram.

Solution: In discussion with Marcel: ""Please implement a message ""No elements to display"" (no pop-up). Please implement it similar to the message we implemented in the Nested Cluster Diagram for the same purpose."""	47487	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	20/Apr/15 1:47 PM	22/Apr/15 3:52 PM														20/Apr/15 3:12 PM;dasm;Verified (revision 960)	"21/Apr/15 10:53 AM;dasm;Problem with message ""No elements to display""
