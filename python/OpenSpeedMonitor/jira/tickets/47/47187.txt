Using a saved query with output format Exel for filtering on an overview page leads to error page	"Reproduce:
* On ""Reports/Spreadsheet Reports"", create a query with output format Excel and save it.
* On the overview page of the report's building block type, try to ""Filter by saved query"" by this saved query.

=> The application redirects to the ""Spreadsheets Report"" and shows an error page (NPE). The overview page cannot be accessed anymore until the session is cleaned.

Workaround is to save a copy of this query with output format ""Simple list"".

Even if no data is lost, a NPE and a dead session is awkward.
If it had a result of a ""sorry, does not work"" message, I would not fix it.

Timebox?
Maybe as a ""learning new territory"" for Timur or Marcel?
