EMF-Import: Error message on EMF-Import after deleting enumeration attribute	"You get the error message ""The file to import is corrupt and could not be read."" (see attached problem report), when you import an EMF-File with deleted enumeration attribute.
_Reproduce:_
- Export full model as XMI
- Delete any enumeration attribute (e.g. Technical State of Health) in Ecore file
- Import changed Zip-File including Metamodel changes with overwrite strategy
- Error message: file corrupt
- If you do not delete all referencing columns for the enumeration attribute, you get the error message: A general technical error occurred. To continue, please click Close or Cancel, or clear the current session.""

_Expected:_ Enumeration attribute gets deleted
Imported zip-file attached, which leads to error message.

_Solution to aim for:_
In both cases an error message ""The file to import is corrupt and could not be read."" should appear."
