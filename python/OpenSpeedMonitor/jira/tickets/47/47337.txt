Content Elements selected by hierarchy	"*Summary:*
Create a mechanism to select inner elements from  Level 1, 2, 3 or Level 1 & 2 or Level 2 & 3 or all 3 levels of hiearchy (restricted to 3 levels of hierarchy).

*As-Is:*
To be checked.

*To-Be:*
Inner Elements can be selected from Level 1, 2 or both of the hierarchy. (analogue for 3 levels)

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Landscape Diagram
* Context menu
* Url
* Legend

*Approach:* 
Default behaviour is to show Level 1 and 2 of the hierarchy. In the context menu the user can change the level of hierarchy with ""Show hierarchical ..."" and in the second level of the context menu: ""Level 1"", ""Level 2"" and ""Level 1 - 2"". The url is updated accordingly and the legend shows ""Level X Building Block Type"", e.g. Level 1 Information Systems. (analogue for 3 levels).
The upward aggregation starts with level 4 (aggreagted to level 3).
No precalculation for the context menu: The options are hard-coded for the options of 3 levels (although may not be available). Default option is ""Show all levels"".

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user opens a Landscape Diagram with Information System as inner elements.
The diagram shows default the first two level of hierarchy.
The user uses secondary click on an Information System to open the context menu.
He hovers over ""Show hierarchical ...""
A second level menu opens and shows ""Level 1"" and ""Level 2"" (as ""Level 1 and 2"" is already selected).
The user clicks on ""Level 2"".
The context menu disappears immediately and only the second level of Information Systems is displayed. The legend is updated accordingly: ""Level 2 Information Systems"" and the url as well.
The same works for 3 levels of hierarchy.


DONE see comment 2 below: concrete example
DONE: see comment below [~wfr] : Provide order of options in the context menu


"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	27/Jan/15 2:15 PM	01/Oct/15 2:32 PM					hierarchy	landscape								"21/May/15 10:37 AM;wfr;Detail for menu

The context menu contains a new filter sub-menu  ""Show with hierarchy level"".
This sub-menu has items:
* ""All levels"" default
* ""Only level 1""
* ""Level 1 - 2""
* ""Level 1 - 3""
* ""Only level 2""
* ""Level 2 - 3""
* ""Only level 3""

Notes
* The order of menu items is the same as in the classic client, with following exception
* The item ""All levels"" is first, because it is the default value.
* All items are always available, even if elements of a deeper level do not exist in the current filter result. This is different from the classic client. The classic client shows ""level 2"" or ""level 1-2"" only if there are elements of level 2 in the current filter result set. 
* There is no ""... are on a level between x and y"" message. This may be an improvement in a _different_ ticket. Idea for _later_: hover text or fading message after changing the hiearchy filter."	"21/May/15 10:45 AM;wfr;Concrete example for aggregation of relationships:

Given: 
* LSD of IS by BP and BU
* IS ""SAP"" has two children: ""SAP-FI"" and ""SAP-CO""
* SAP-FI is connected to BU ""Investement""
* SAP-CO is connected to BU ""Controlling""
* Both SAP-CO and SAP-FI are connected to BP ""Management""
* SAP (parent) is not connected to a BP or BU

With no hierarchy filter, that is ""Show all levels"":
* SAP-FI is in the cell of Investment and Management
* SAP-CO is in the cell of Controlling and Management
* SAP is in no cell at all.

With filter ""Only level 2"": same as above

With filter ""Only level 1"": 
* SAP is in both cells Investement and Management; and Controlling and Management"".
* SAP-FI and SAP-CO are in no cell at all.

BUT the feature ""upwards aggregation"" (see comment of Wolfgang from 21/May 10:45 AM) is missing. [~ach] knows the concept and the code, how to implement it."
