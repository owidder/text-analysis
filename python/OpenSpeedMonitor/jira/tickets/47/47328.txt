Sprint 6? Paths between building block types	"Implement all valid connections (1-step, 2-step or Business mapping) between an inner and an outer element, i.e.

http://www.iteraplan.de/wiki/display/IPNINE/Connections+in+the+Nesting+Cluster+Diagram

This ticket has 3 parts:

1) Legend: Show the actual used path for the diagram

2) Context menu: Create a new selection in the context menu for the different paths between the actual inner and outer element. (The new entry should be named as ""Use relationship"" and a second level menu with all valid ordered paths).

3) Algorithm: Calculate the valid paths and the ordering of the paths.

For 3) exists an alternative Plan B with hard-coded lists of valid paths and their ordering (to be provided by Wolfgang and Marcel)."

And for the user there is no difference between these 2 paths. So, please combine both paths in the diagram. That means, each time a path “comes” to an InformationFlow, you join all paths with InformationFlows directly at the beginning relationship end. This is a special case treatment, but we think, it’s the best user experience.
So, in the new nested cluster diagram, you just see:

informationSystems/businessObject (and all InformationFlows in the background are joint).
