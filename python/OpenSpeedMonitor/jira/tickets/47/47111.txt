Edit all elements in all places	"*Priority 6*

To the existing edit functions in the single item, list of items and diagram views, add the remaining editing functions for

* all types of elements
* all attributes (note: used defined)
* all types of attributes (more enumerations, ...)
* all relationships
* all relationships with attributes (about 2)
* hard: business mapping 3+1-arity!

* in all diagrams
* in all lists
* as single item

Idea: Downsize ticket: ""edit in single item view and tabular list""
