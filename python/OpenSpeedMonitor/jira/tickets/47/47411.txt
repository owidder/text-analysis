Issue with path name composing	"Summary:

children/businessObjectAssociations/businessObject
children/informationFlows*/businessObject

In both variants the middle part is relation type, then I should skip this part due to WIKI ""Connections for NCD"" spec
And as result we have ""Children - Business object"" as path name for both paths."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	11/Feb/15 11:03 AM	17/Apr/15 10:17 AM														"26/Mar/15 2:18 PM;wfr;Problem also without the self-ref-relationship in front.

businessObjectAssociations/businessObject
and 
informationFlows*/businessObject

both are displayed as 
Business object

Solution: rename (localized) name of rfealtionship end in Metamodel on the server side.

NOTE that fixing this issue needs updating the SERVER and INTEGRATING this updated server with the client.

* change (localized to English) name of the REE leading to the target type, so that the shortened path is unique again.
* do this change on the server side, in the code that builds (""loads"") the metamodel
* this change may include localization resource
* this change will affect the displayed REE names in the classic client, too. Look if the user guide on iteraQL needs to be updated.
* all client JS code should already use (localized) names for display, and (non localized) persistent names for all internal identification of metamodel elements (types, REEs,...). Make sure it does.
