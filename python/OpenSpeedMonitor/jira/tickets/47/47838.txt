Toolarea for the IFD	"*Summary:*

Create an toolarea with mock data in the appbar for the IFD with placeholder for future actions.



*Specification on the wiki page:*

https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=51609741#Oberfl%C3%A4chensollkonzeptf%C3%BCrDiagrammeiniteraplan-ToolArea



*Approach:*

All functionality of the context menu is duplicated in the toolarea. At the moment there is no context menu in the IFD.



This toolarea is available for all other diagrams, but hidden at the moment.
