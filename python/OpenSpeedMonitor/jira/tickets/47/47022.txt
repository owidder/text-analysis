Partial import with conservative strategy doesn't delete association objects	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_
# On iteraplan's Export/Import page, check the ""partial"" checkbox and select Information System as type
# Download data
# Modify the data by removing one data row in the Isr2BoAssociation sheet
# Upload the file with strategy ""Conservative""

_Expected:_ One Isr2BoAssociation deleted, one Information System changed, one Business Object changed
_Actual:_ No changes. It does, however, work when doing the same in a full import.

_Reason:_
In {{CUMergeStrategy#isApplicable(DeleteDiff)}}, the method {{existsInRightModel}} is called. The method checks the building blocks connected by the association to delete. If they are present on the right-side (the imported) model, then the deletion is assumed to be intentional, and allowed.
Since this is a partial import, the business object connected to the association to delete is marked as reference object only, and thus not recognized as ""truly"" present in the right-side model => deletion is not allowed.

This check for {{ObjectExpression#isReferenceOnly}} in method {{existsInRightModel}} is probably there for a reason, so before fixing this issue identify why it is needed and proceed accordingly."
