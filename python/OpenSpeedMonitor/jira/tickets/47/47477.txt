Option to span content elements	"*Update: Remove spanning completely*



Original issue description below

###

Should span elements both as horizontally and vertically



Effected parts:

1. Context menu

2. Configuration

3. TableModelBuilder





The options for the user are ""no spanning"", ""horizontal"", ""vertical"".

No ""both horizontal and vertical"" option.



All items in a content cell are boxes in one ""stack"" or column"". No wider columns with two or more boxes side by side.



For horizontal spans, move the spanning items to the top, and put the non-spanning items below.



Example: Cell 1,1 has elements A, B, Cell 1,2 has elements B and C.

Make it 

- one wide box for element B, spanning both cells, in the upper half of both cells

- one regular box for A, in Cell 1,1, lower half

- one regular box for C in Cell 1,2, lower half.



[____B____]

[A]___|___ [C]







For vertical spans, make them from top to bottom as far as possible.

There can be breaks in the spanning box because of additional items ""in the middle"".



Example

Three cells, from top to bottom, with elements A, B; A, C; A, D.

So A should be spanning all three cells, BUT

C must be drawn in the middle cell as well.

So the box for C breaks the spanning box, and the spanning box should be on the top and middle cell.

---
given two adjacent cells, one on top of the other,

and two elements that are in both cells,

then we can span only one those elements as a single box,

but not the other element,

that will  still be shown as two separate boxes.

 

So, as my spontaneous decision:

  Take the lexicographically first one.

 

What is important: the system must be deterministic and predictable for the user.

So choosing randomly is _not_ an option."
