New Client: Create links between classic & new client	"*Summary:*
Create a link between the nesting cluster configuration page in the classic iteraplan client and the nesting cluster diagram in the new client.
Create a link between the landscape configuration page in the classic iteraplan client and the landscape diagram in the new client.

*As-Is:*
No linkage is existing.

*To-Be:*
The user can directly switch from the configuration pages of the classic client to the diagrams of the new client and back. But no information (e.g. about parameters, settings, etc.) is exchanged.

*Affected parts of the system:*
Classic client:
* Nesting Cluster Configuration Page
* Landscape Diagram Configuration Page

New Client:
* Nesting Cluster Diagram
* Landscape Diagram

If you have any questions, please contact WFR or MSR.

*Splitting/Dependencies*
Note that this ticket intentionally affects both the classic web UI and the new JS client. The changes in both clients can be done independently.

*IXD*
Static navigation goes into the navigation menu, generally. 
These navigation actions are always available, but not visible.

In addition, an important navigation action is a global action in the app/menu bar.
Here only the locally relevant navigation is visible, that is the link to the peer view in the classic client, but not the link to the other diagram configuration page.

The new client should have the naviation action in both places, navigation menu and app/menu bar
