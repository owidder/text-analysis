No radiobox preselected in query search on overview pages	"On an overview page: Open tab ""Queries"" and select an attribute.

Expected:
The lower of the two radioboxes on the right side of the form (the one with the dropdown options) is preselected (since 3.4.1).

Actual:
None of the two radioboxes is preselected. When the ""Send query"" button is clicked, you get a NPE:
{code}
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at de.iteratec.iteraplan.businesslogic.reports.query.options.TabularReporting.QPart.getPattern(QPart.java:210)
{code}

The workaround is easy: Select one of the two radiobuttons manually.

Fix it, so that the upper radiobox is preselected."		Bug	iteraplan PO	30/Mar/15 3:57 PM	13/Apr/15 8:37 AM					query	queryform	search	ui						10/Apr/15 3:47 PM;nle;Requirements from ITERAPLAN-2848 should still be valid.
