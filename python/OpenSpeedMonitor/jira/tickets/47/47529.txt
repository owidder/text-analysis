NCD: Second level of Context menu in IE11	"Summary: sometimes second level of Context menu for inner/outer elements doesn't appear in the browser IE11 after removing applied options in the legend

1. Go to NCD page
2. Use any coloring/filtering options for inner/outer elements
3. Remove applied option in the legend
4. Open Context menu for inner/outer elements
Actual: second level of Context menu for inner/outer elements doesn't appear
Expected: Appearing Context menu should not be depended on removing applied options"		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Mar/15 2:57 PM	16/Apr/15 3:51 PM					sporadic									"15/Apr/15 11:00 AM;wfr;Recommendation:
Check if the behavior is frequent, or deterministic

IF it is infrequent and can be avoided by simply re-doing the gesture: DEFER
IF it frequent or without workaround: FIX NOW

or reproduce yourself "	"15/Apr/15 2:35 PM;msr;Only for IE 11.
It happens more often, if the browser is used for a long time. The context menu can still be opened after a few seconds or minutes (browser got ""slower"") or with several clicks."	15/Apr/15 4:32 PM;dasm;Could be reproduced if user will use coloring and filtering options step by step and then remove them from the legend settings directly. In this case the second level of context menu is stoping appearing
