Legend for border line types of content elements	"Add the border line types of content elements to the legend, i.e.

* Add a new section to the legend (analogue to coloring and filtering), which only appears, when border line types are selected

* The ""headline"" for this section is the name of the attribute, e.g. if the line type is computated by complexity, then the headline is ""Complexity""

* The content of this section are the values of the selected attribute within a white box with the specific border line

The legend remains read-only - no interaction."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	09/Apr/15 5:00 PM	22/Apr/15 3:47 PM					legend									"09/Apr/15 5:00 PM;msr;
*Summary:*
Implement different border line types for inner elements, which depend on a enumeration or numeric attribute (analogue mechanism to coloring).

*As-Is:*
There exists only one solid border line for inner elements.

*To-Be:*
Border lines can be specifically selected by enumeration or numeric attribute.

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Landscape Diagram inner boxes
* Legend
* Url
* Context menu

*Approach:* 
Analogue to the coloring mechanism implement a mechanism for border line types (solid, dotted, ...) of inner boxes.
The new context menu is named ""Line type by enumeration property"" and ""Line type by numeric property"".
Adapt the legend and url accordingly.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user has the same options as in the coloring of inner elements, i.e. analogue context menu actions, analogue legend, analogue url, ..."	"20/Apr/15 9:04 AM;dasm;Verified
