"Show only modified in" in the context menu for inner elements	"Steps to reproduce: 
1. Go to NCD
2. Open Context menu for inner elements
Actual: ""Show only modified in""  appears as independent option
Expected: Probably this menu option is duplicate of ""Last modification time"" of filtering by date properties
Do we need both of them?"	47646	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	24/Apr/15 9:21 AM	05/May/15 2:07 PM													"Workspace: Windows 8.1
