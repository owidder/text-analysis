Adjust REST-interface and Import to take advantage of continuous model reload	"Currently, the micro import used by the REST-API and the Excel/XMI-Import use some explicit reloads of the complete elastic model.

Most of these explicit reloads are not necessary anymore with the continuous elastic model update.
Please adjust."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	02/Feb/15 1:42 PM	13/Apr/15 10:00 AM					elastic	update
