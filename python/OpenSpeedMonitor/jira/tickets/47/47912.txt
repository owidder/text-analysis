Missing direction arrows in special configuration of classic IFD	"_Reproduce:_

# Create an interface between two Information Systems which each have a parent. Set the direction to something different from ""no direction"".

# Go to Visualisations -> Information Flow Diagram

# On first configuration page, create a query which returns at least the two information systems mentioned before, and their parents. Also check the last checkbox in the ""Rework query results"" section, as seen in the attached image

# Send query and use results

# Make sure the Business Object checkbox in the line caption settings is unchecked

# Create diagram



_Expected:_ The two Information Systems mentioned in the first step are not displayed. Instead, their top-level ancestors are displayed, with an interface connecting both. The connecting line shows arrows according to the interface direction.



_Actual:_ Everything works as expected, only no direction arrows are shown.



_Reason:_

{{HideSubInformationSystemReleasesWithConnectionMergingStrategy#copyInterface()}} does not copy interface direction.



_Fix:_

* Also copy interface direction

* When merging Interfaces (in {{#mergeInterfaces()}}, merge directions equivalent to the calculation in {{#setNewDirectionsForExistingTransport()}}

* Add to documentation that we recommend to not use any line caption settings, except maybe ""Business Objects"", when reworking the query results as described above.
