Non-localized decimal numbers on overview pages and in CSV Netto Export	"Numbers in number attribute columns are shown with ""."" instead of "","" with german localization. This problem occurs in CSV ""netto"" export and in GUI tables in overview pages.

The code probably uses BigDecimal.toString(), but this method's behavior is not affected by localization. Read the notes in the method's JavaDoc:

1. There is a one-to-one mapping between the distinguishable BigDecimal values and the result of this conversion. That is, every distinguishable BigDecimal value (unscaled value and scale) has a unique string representation as a result of using toString. If that string representation is converted back to a BigDecimal using the BigDecimal(String) constructor, then the original value will be recovered. 
2. The string produced for a given number is always the same; it is not affected by locale. This means that it can be used as a canonical string representation for exchanging decimal data, or as a key for a Hashtable, etc. Locale-sensitive number formatting and parsing is handled by the java.text.NumberFormat class and its subclasses.

For that reason, the code should use either a localized String representation or a ""double"" value (and its String representation), but never use BigDecimal.toString() as result.

For the CSV netto export, this can be accomplished by a conditional clause for number (and date?) attribute values in NettoCSVTransformer.transform(), similar to NettoExcelTransformer.transform().

For the GUI tables on the overview pages, the method NumberAT.getLocalizedValueString() should be used for columns with number attribute values. This fix might be a little more complicated than in the CSV export.
