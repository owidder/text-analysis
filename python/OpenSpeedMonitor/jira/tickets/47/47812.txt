Find and implement good solution for licenses with several datasources	"Current situation:
On enforcement points like the Excel Export functionality, the license information is read from the currently active datasource and then checked.
However, the initial license update page (the one to use before login) only allows adding a license for the master datasource.
So currently licenses for secondary datasources need to be added manually.

On the personal demo system, secondary datasources need to be created automatically.

Current solution for personal demo system: The MySQL dump file of initial data used to initialize new datasources was made to include the license.

Issues with the current solution:
* Maintainability of personal demos:
** adjusting the database dump is one more step during migration of personal demo systems to take care of.
** Need to update the licenses of all active demo accounts before they run out
* Customers using several datasources most likely will be confused when encountering the license error message, since they added the license to iteraplan already.

Possible ways to solve this:
* Find an easy technical way to avoid all or most of the above issues.
* Document the need to add licenses to secondary datasources in user guide, and the necessary steps for migration of the personal demo system in the release process documentation"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	09/Jun/15 9:55 AM	19/Jan/16 4:06 PM					license
