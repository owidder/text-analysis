Partial diagram for NCD	"For LSD, see ITERAPLAN-3793



In the NCD, add a limitation for the number of elements displayed.

If the limitation triggers, show ""51342 elements left out"" pseudo element.



In the NCD diagram element processor, 

whenever the filters change, 

that is in the watch function in the controller,

after the regular load, 

call the new function $scope.el.limitYourself() (function working title) of DiagramElement



limitYourself counts outer and inner (and nested inner) elements.

and finds the last outer element that falls below the limitations threshold.



After that last element, remove all other (outer) elements (and their children) 

and add a pseudo element with text, but without sub-items.



To find the actual threshold value, experiment in adverse environment, that is IE.

Then put it into the code. No config.



The limit for the elements is hard-coded and the exact limit needs to be tested during this ticket.

Other optimizations are needed, for example min/max of numeric attributes, but not in this ticket."
