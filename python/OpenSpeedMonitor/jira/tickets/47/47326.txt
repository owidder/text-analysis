Computation for filtering content elements	"Depends on IPNINE-378, IPNINE-379 (configuration attributes names are required)
========================

*Summary:*
Create a filter for content elements.

*As-Is:*
There exists no filtering.

*To-Be:*
Content elements can be filtered by enumeration, numeric, text or date attributes.

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Landscape diagram

*Approach:* 
Implement the filtering analogue to the filtering in the Nested Cluster Diagram. Use the the same logic and the same legend.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user can do exactly the same filtering of inner elements as in the Nested Cluster Diagram, i.e. same legend, same url, ..."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	26/Jan/15 10:40 AM	22/Apr/15 3:48 PM					attribute	filter	landscape							"07/Apr/15 9:18 AM;msr;-Use the following wording for menu entries:-

{code}LSDConfiguration.prototype.setContentElementsFilter = function(filters){code}
would it better to rename this function into LSDConfiguration.prototype.setContentElementsFilter*s*"	"14/May/15 4:24 PM;anma;this parameter is for developers. if code = no you have 'clear' query URL string without any coding

method has been renamed"
