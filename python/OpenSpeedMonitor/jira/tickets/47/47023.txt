Excel import doesn't work if there are empty date cells in the excel file	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_

# Download Excel data from iteraplan's Export/Import page

# Delete the contents of an date cell in the Excel file, for example a runtime period date on the Information System sheet

# Import the file



_Expected:_ File is read and, depending on strategy, no changes or an unsetting of the date value is done

_Actual:_ NullPointerException resulting in a general error reported on the import page



The import should be able to handle empty date cells.



{color:red}UPDATE:{color} For the ""name"" column please throw a meaningul exception, but for all other columns it is depending on the import strategy:

* If you just add the value, please ignore the empty cells.

* But if you overwrite a value, please delete the old value."
