Spreadsheet reports direct links do not work	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_
# Navigate to iteraplan -> Reports -> Spreadsheet Reports
# In saved query list, click on the link icon for saved query ""Future information systems"" and copy the link from the appearing popup window.
# Try to open the link in a new browser tab/window

_Expected:_ iteraplan spreadsheet reports page opens, with the query ""Future information systems"" loaded, executed and its result list displayed.

_Actual:_ General error page.

_Reason:_ The link is not correct. What iteraplan offers as links is as follows:
{noformat}
[server]/iteraplan/show/graphicalreporting/fastexport/generateSavedQuery.do?[parameters]
{noformat}
Correct would be either
{noformat}
[server]/iteraplan/show/graphicalreporting/../fastexport/generateSavedQuery.do?[parameters]
{noformat} (important, the *../* part, as in direct links for graphical reports)
or
{noformat}
[server]/iteraplan/show/fastexport/generateSavedQuery.do?[parameters]
{noformat} (as links for tabular reports in 3.3)"		Bug	iteraplan PO	11/Nov/14 11:20 AM	14/Nov/14 2:13 PM					report	savedquery	spreadsheet							14/Nov/14 10:12 AM;isc;I have tested the changes locally and on the nightly.
