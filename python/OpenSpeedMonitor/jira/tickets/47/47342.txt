Border line types for inner elements	"before start: split it by components, as in coloring elements; *ticket is split to 456, 457, 458 and 459*

*Summary:*
Implement different border line types for inner elements, which depend on a enumeration or numeric attribute (analogue mechanism to coloring).

*As-Is:*
There exists only one solid border line for inner elements.

*To-Be:*
Border lines can be specifically selected by enumeration or numeric attribute.

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Landscape Diagram inner boxes
* Legend
* Url
* Context menu

*Approach:* 
Analogue to the coloring mechanism implement a mechanism for border line types (solid, dotted, ...) of inner boxes.
The new context menu is named ""Line type by enumeration property"" and ""Line type by numeric property"".
Adapt the legend and url accordingly.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user has the same options as in the coloring of inner elements, i.e. analogue context menu actions, analogue legend, analogue url, ...
