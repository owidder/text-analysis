Date attributes as axes	"*Summary:*
Make enumeration and date attributes available as axes elements.

everything BUT menu/configuration (-376) and enumeration attribtues for axis (-377).

*As-Is:*
Only building blocks are available as axes elements.

*To-Be:*
All enumeration and date attributes are available as axes elements.

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Landscape Diagram

*Approach:*
Use the context menu entries ""Change row association"" or ""Change column association"". In this context menu the user can either select the connected building block types or the available enumeration or date attributes. Create a second level menu for ""Relation"" (for building block types) or ""Attribute"" (for attributes.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The users opens a Landscape Diagram with Information System as inner element and Infrastructure Element and Technical Component as axes elements.
The user uses secondary click on a Technical Component.
A context menu opens immediately.
The user hovers over ""Change column association"".
A second level menu opens immediately.
The user hovers over ""Attribute"".
A third level menu opens immediately.
The user selects ""System size"".
The context menu disappears immediately and the diagram is updated accordingly, i.e. with system size as columns and Infrastructure Elements as rows.

This works for any enumeration or date attribute, independently of the inner element or the other axis element.


Clarifying note:
If an axis is a date attribute, the items of this axis are only the date values (resolution is day) that are used as values of the attributes of the content items.
As opposed to: all days spanning the interval from the first date to the last date of that attribute of the content items.
