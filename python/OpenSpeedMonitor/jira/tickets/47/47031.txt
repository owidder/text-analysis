Query search on overview pages with an enum attribute and a leading asterisk leads to error page	"Reproduce:
* Go to an element overview page (for example ""IS"")
* Open the search tab ""Queries""
* Select an enum attribute (for example ""Complexity"")
* Select something like ""Contains""
* Enter a search value with a leading asterisk, for example ""*age""
* Press Enter / Click ""Search""
=> Error page

The error is caused by the check in mehtod:
de.iteratec.iteraplan.businesslogic.reports.query.node.EnumAttributeLeafNode.createNode(Type<?>, Extension, int, Comparator, String)

Another issue happens in this search:
When a enum attribute has a enum literal called ""null"", and this value is assigned to a building block, then the query search with empty search value finds these elements.
