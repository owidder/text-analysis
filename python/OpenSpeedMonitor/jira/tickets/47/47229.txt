Refactoring of DiagramController	"1. New file structure: Split code in smaller units (1 JS file per component), even 1 folder for each directive

2. Thin view (thin template: a.b or f(a.b.) maximum)

3. Thin controller (goes hand-in-hand with file structure and new services) (for the moment static helper classes are ok and may be changed in the future)

Possible split by functionality:
1. (9 sp)
•	Creating general structure of NCD component, link dependences, initial data binding
•	Creating model's data manipulation subsystem (wrappers, filters, sorters etc)
2. (5 sp)
•	Creating SVG element drawing subsystem
•	Creating colouring subsystem
•	Creating NCD context menu subsystems, including fix non-transclude context-menu directive
•	Implements moving elements feature
3. (5 sp)
•	Implements filter feature
•	Implements sort feature   
•	Implements highlight feature   
•	Implements export functionality
•	Stabilization & testing"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	05/Dec/14 9:25 AM	23/Dec/14 10:27 AM					refactoring
