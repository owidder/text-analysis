Change next release version to 5	"Our next release will not be iteraplan 3.5, but *iteraplan 5*.

* Change current SNAPSHOT version to 5.0-SNAPSHOT, both in pom and build.properties
* The release should be displayed as *iteraplan 5*, not iteraplan 5.0 or 5.0.0. For this there need to be some changes:
** Separate display of iteraplan version on login screen from build ID and set it accordingly to display *iteraplan 5*
** Find whether there are other occasions where the iteraplan version is displayed, aside from the login screen and the footer, and change them to display *iteraplan 5* as well.
** Continue to use detailed build ID for iteraplan footer
** *maybe*: Change text on start screen from ""iteraplan - simple and effective IT Landscaping"" to ""iteraplan 5 - simple and effective IT Landscaping"". Check with [~fka] whether this should be done.
** It should be possible to easily set the displayed version with a single additional property."

Startscreen text adjusted.
Replaced full iteraplan version on login screen with new variable for major version.
Did not find other (than mentioned) occasions of iteraplan version in the UI.
Documentation not necessary, as this are just little UI adjustments."	24/Nov/14 10:13 AM;fka;On the login screen the version number is missing	"05/Dec/14 2:33 PM;fam;Found and fixed error.
