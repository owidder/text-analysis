GET-Request on multiple sessions lead to out of memory	"Follow-up ticket to ITERAPLAN-2792

As described in above ticket multiple sessions with many GET-Requests on a big dataset lead to a memory error (out of memory).
Multiple sessions presumably are created due to the use of basic authentication for the requests, which results in a new session for each request.

Analyse and fix this error (if possible with reasonable effort).

First idea: Each sessions loads its own metamodel and, most importantly, model. This could be a possible reason for the high memory usage. In that case one possible fix is to find a way to discard the session after the response was sent, as the session won't be used anymore anyway (This is only true for the use of the basic authentication method.)
See whether Restlet or Spring offer configuration options for such a case."		Bug	iteraplan PO	13/Nov/14 2:41 PM	03/Dec/14 3:30 PM					memory	metamodel
