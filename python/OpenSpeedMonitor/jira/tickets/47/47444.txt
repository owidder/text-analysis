Create go.js Diagram with node template for content and axes boxes.	"In the LSD diagram configuration (D), add to the go.js Diagram a node template for the colored boxes of the LSD content matrix and the category axes.

Details:
1.
* Remove static dummy elements of the LSD diagram configuration (D).
* The node template should have a data binding for 
** coordinates (x,y) and 
** dimensions (height, width) and
** text (one line)
** background color
** not yet: icon
** not yet: multiline label

2.
* create statically in the LSD main class (C) a mockup graph with nodes that contain all properties that are data-bound in the node template of the LSD diagram configuration (D)
* the resulting diagram should be simple
** 2 rows, 2 columns
** 5 items, because one cell has 2 items, the other three cells have exactely 1 item
* the names of the building block types of the axes are also variable texts. It should be part of the graph nodes, too.
* Note: the type of the vertical axis (e.g. Technical Component) should be horizontal (normal) text, not vertical. it should be placed above the items of the axis.
