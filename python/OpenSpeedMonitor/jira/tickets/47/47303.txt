New Client: Logging	"*Summary:*
Implement a detailed logging of relevant activities for the new client.

*As-Is:*
There exists no logging.

*To-Be:*
A logging is implemented and can be used for e.g. problem analysis.

*Affected parts of the system:*
New client:
* All parts of the system

If you have any questions, please contact WFR or MSR.

*Unsorted Notes*
* use the angular $log service
* start _now_ with $log,
* later: inject the remote log service instead of $log

* cave: angular has only a single switch for debug on/off. All higher levels are written always.
* use a query parameter in the start URI to switch on debug messages. default is no debug messages.
* error only on 
* in parallel, log into a server log
* create a (micro) service 
* better: find a ready-made micro service running on tomcat, and a matching angular service
* logging to the server should be asynchronous
* logging is not required to be authenticated, the DOS risk is minimal, and we want to see client-side problems with authentication in the log on the server.
* write half a page of log level guide.

3 Subtasks (to be generated)
* Enrich Javascript code with $log
* Create server-side service
* Add Angular service talking to server
