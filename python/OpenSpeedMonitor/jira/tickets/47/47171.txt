Update user guide structure	"In discussion with FKA and WFR, we came up with a new structure for the user guide (see attached screenshot and presentation).

Please restructure the user guide and move the pages into the new structure.

Some pages may occur multiple times within different contexts,
e.g. how to edit a BB occurs in A ""Quick Start"" with a short description, in B ""Edit BB"" longer described and in C ""BBs and attributes"" for further details.

Please consult MSR before restructuring. Feedback is welcome.

Additionally, create a sample page with good examples for other developers within the user guide."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	13/Nov/14 3:18 PM	05/Dec/14 1:26 PM					documentation									"04/Dec/14 4:30 PM;msr;Restructured user guide:
