[Landscape Diagrams] text shrinking does not work correctly	"Text shrinking for Landscape diagrams in iteraplan 3.4 does not works anymore like in iteraplan 3.3.x.
In iteraplan 3.3.0, the text size was for all content elements (in Landscape Diagrams) the same.  In iteraplan 3.4.0 all elements have a different text size. 

With activated text shrinking, the text size of content elements should be for all elements the same.
