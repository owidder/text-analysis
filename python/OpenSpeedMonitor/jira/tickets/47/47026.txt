Submitting a query search on an overview page by using the ENTER key works incorrect	"On an element type's overview page, on tab ""Queries"", when you configure a query and submit it by hitting ""Enter"", then the result is incorrect, because the wrong search strategy is used (""SEARCH_BY_INDEX"" instead of ""SEARCH_BY_QUERY_FORM"").

Clicking on the ""Search"" button instead of hitting ENTER works, because the button's javascript action sets the right search strategy. This is the current ""workaround""."
