Unit Tests for NCD	"Ticket for unit tests testing features and bugs of the new NCD.

Please create a sub-task for tests for each new NCD ticket once it is implemented.

For each unit test subtask:
* Is the code to be tested in an easy to test location? If not, move it if easily possible.
* Only unit tests, not too large-scale
* If it takes more than 4 hours, consult with wfr or sfe.
* Large refactorings are not scope of these issues"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	02/Apr/15 3:17 PM	03/Jun/15 2:48 PM					newClient									"11/May/15 1:42 PM;tam;More analysis of sub-tasks before doing:
