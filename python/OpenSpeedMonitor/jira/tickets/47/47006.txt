Edit connected elements - various	"Various points on the editing of connected elements:

* Delete (click on ""x""-icon) does not work

* Start of edit mode must be by click on *content* (or placeholder ""no elements""), instead of title of list. Click on title is already taken for expand/collapse.

* Leave edit mode by a click anywhere else."	47009	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	29/Sep/14 1:23 PM	09/Jun/15 5:06 PM
