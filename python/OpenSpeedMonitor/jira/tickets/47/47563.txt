NCD: Saving options of  nesting and highlighting 	"Summary: Changing of outer type should not cancel applied options for inner type (if they still connect to each other)

Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to NCD page
2. Use ISD as outer type and IS as inner type
3. Highlight any inner element
4. Use Nesting by children
5. Change outer type to Architectural Domain (or to any other)
Actual: Options of Nesting and highlighting  were canceled
Expected: All applied options for inner elements should be saved with changing outer type (if used inner type still connected to new outer)

Comments: 
Correct behavior:
1. All used options for inner elements should be canceled only with changing inner type.
2. All used options for outer type should be canceled only with changing outer type
3. All used options for inner/outer type should be canceled with changing inner/outer type to other which doesn't connect to used inner/outer type
