Portfolio config doesn't load the correct state of 'scaling' option	"On the 2nd page of Portfolio diagram configuration, in the 'Advanced' section:
When the option for scaling is set to ""Scaling (local context), the option is saved correctly.
But when it is loaded, the option will show ""No scaling (Global context)"" again.

Make the configuration load the option correctly."		Bug	iteraplan PO	19/Jan/15 1:18 PM	20/Jan/15 12:26 PM					configuration	portfolio	savedquery
