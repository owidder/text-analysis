Continuous elastic reload doesn't respect position values	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_
# Edit virtual root element of Business Processes -> change ordering of the top level processes
# Save
# Download Excel data from Import/Export page

_Expected:_ position values of the top level Business Processes reflects the *changed* ordering
_Actual:_ position values of the top level Business Processes reflects the *old* ordering

_Possible reason:_ position values in hibernate entities are managed by hibernate, thus possibly not yet updated at the time the elastic update event listener gets notified of change events.

Please analyse and fix."

This should be fixed after ITERAPLAN-3083 is closed."
