Automatic text color based on background color	"In all diagrams with boxes with text and background color, text color should be selected automatically according to the background color: 
* if the background color is dark, the text color is white 
* if the background color is bright, the text color is black. 

As a first solution, the dark/bright threshold is 0.5 brightness Iightness) in a HSL notation of the background color. 
Starting with that, we test visually if this looks right. 
At the same time, we ask Tanya for a good rule of thumb for that problem. 
Maybe we change the threshold value to have more black or white text. 
For text on background with fixed color, for example the diagram title or fixed text in the legend, the text color is still static, not computed. 

*Priority note* 
Even if the solution above is most elegant, we can release ip5 without it. 
We could advise the user to choose appropriate background colors, or as an alternative to this ticket we could add a user operated switch for the background color, or several switches (inner, outer, maybe other box)
