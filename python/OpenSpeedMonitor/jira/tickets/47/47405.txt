Possibility to limit number of custom attributes	"iteraplan should be able to limit the number of custom attributes the user can create. This limit should be globally, it should be enforced when creating a new custom attribute and before spreadsheet and diagram reports.

This limitation should only be effective with the lite edition. Set it to 10. No need to configure this number, it might be hard coded.

Use the license key component that already checks if the license is still valid.
empty licensee name means: this is the lite edition, do the check.
A handful of more enforcement points.
use dao for attribute types to count current number of attribute definitions.
No code variants!
