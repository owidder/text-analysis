List view should work dynamically for all Building Block Types	"*TIME-BOX 4 HOURS*

*As-Is:*
Default columns in the list view are hard-coded and are designed for Information Systems as Building Block Type.

*To-Be:*
Only name, description and status (if available for the Building Block Type) are in the default list view. All other columns are dynamically calculated and be added.

Check, how related Building Block Types can be calculated dynamically, too. If the implementation is possible with small effort, do it. If not remove the related Building Block Types.

Check, if search still works."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	20/Apr/15 4:07 PM	25/Apr/15 11:07 AM					newClient									"25/Apr/15 10:13 AM;msr;Redesigned list view. Filtering only works for name and description. Sorting works only for name and status.
BUT structure of code is still like in prototype and needs to be refactored."
