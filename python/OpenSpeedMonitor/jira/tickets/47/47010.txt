2-column name/description for lists of connected elements	"In the exisiting Information System single item view, change all lists of connected elements to a 2-column tabular layout.

Name has normal font size, description a slightly smaller font size.

No column headers ""Name"" nor ""Description"". 
No lines, no color striping, only space for grouping.
