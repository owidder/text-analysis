ALREADY IMPLEMENTED? 8 additional Building Block types as inner elements	"This story completes all stand-alone Building Block Types as inner elements ( IPNINE-204):

*Summary:*
For the existing implementation of the Nesting Cluster Diagram, add the function to use the 8 additional types of building blocks as inner elements.

*As-Is:*
5 Building Block Types are available as inner elements of the Nesting Cluster Diagram.

*To-be:*
All standalone Building Block Types are available as inner elements.
The following building block types need to be additionally implemented as inner elements:

* Business Process, 
* Business Unit, 
* Product, 
* Project
* Business Function
* Business Domain,
* Information System Domain
* Architectural Domain

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Nesting Cluster Diagram
* Inner boxes
* Outer boxes

*UI (already implemented in IPNINE-204)*:
_In the list of elements view, the action ""as Nesting Cluster Diagram"" is unchanged, but it works for above building block types, list see above._
_In the NCD view, add actions (in context menu and in menu bar) to switch to a different building block type for the inner element._

*Diagram:*
Structure of the diagram unchanged, but different content:

*Behavior (additional functionality):*
+If the user navigates from a list of building block type X, there is exactly one outer type Y for each X. The diagram uses X and Y initially. The user may change Y later.+

_Already implemented in IPNINE-204:_ If the user switches the inner element type from X to Y in a Nesting Cluster Diagram with outer element type Z, and if Z is connected to Y, then Z is used for the new NCD. The user may change Z later. 
If Z is not connected, the default outer type for Y is used in the NCD, just as coming form a list view of type Y.

Default outer types for inner types:
* Inner type: Business Process- Outer type: Information System
* Inner type: Business Unit - Outer type: Information System
* Inner type: Product - Outer type: Information System
* Inner type: Project - Outer type: Information System
* Inner type: Business Function - Outer type: Information System
* Inner type: Business Domain - Outer type: Information System
* Inner type: Information System Domain - Outer type: Information System
* Inner type: Architectural Domain - Outer type: Information System

*Acceptance criteria:*
In the item list view of Product, the user can click the action ""As NCD"", and the system displays a NCD with the Products from the list, grouped by Information Systems.
More general, the user can do this for every list of elements. 

In a NCD, the user can click an action ""use Interfaces as inner elements"", and the diagram updates accordingly.
More general: in every NCD with inner element type X, the user can switch to any other element type Y.

For each type T, the NCD will have the specified default outer type initially. When switching the inner type, the outer type is unchanged if it is connected to the new inner type.

The solution uses the metamodel information from the REST API."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	11/Nov/14 2:53 PM	23/Jan/15 2:55 PM					buildingblock	nesting								23/Jan/15 2:55 PM;msr;Already implemented in actual version.
