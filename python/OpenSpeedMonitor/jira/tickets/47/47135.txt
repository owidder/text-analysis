Sprint 7? Long names in boxes	"-Estimation without user interaction-
*Summary:*
Implement a procedure for long names in boxes, e.g. clip only, or wider boxes, or more lines? NOT: smaller font size.
Idea: Use clipping and wider boxes.

*As-Is:*
(To be checked)

*To-Be:*
1. If only a few names are too long for the inner boxes (5% of the boxes), use text clipping.
2. If more than 5% of the names are too long, use wider boxes for all inner boxes in the diagram instead of text clipping (no clipping).
3. If the width of the inner boxes doubles, use additionally text clipping (clipping & width).
-Let user decide about sizing of boxes.-

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Nesting Cluster Diagram

*Approach:*
-Make the frame of the boxes ""editable"", i.e. the user can drag all 4 sides of a frame to make all boxes wider or taller (and more narrow and smaller). Depending on the new size of the boxes, use text clipping or not.-

*Acceptance Criteria:*
-The user starts with the view of an open NCD with IS as inner elements.-
-The user hovers over a frame of a box.-
-A symbol for editing appears (e.g. <->).-
-The user click and holds on one side of the box with primary click (""dragging"").-
-The box width/length is updated immediately during dragging.-
-The user stops dragging.-
-All boxes in the diagram are updated to the new size and text clipping is used if necessary.-

-The steps above work for all boxes.-"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	04/Nov/14 8:42 AM	24/Feb/15 2:45 PM														"18/Feb/15 10:22 AM;msr;Font size:
