[Cluster Diagram] Selection from a list provides a false result	"I created an Enumeration Attribute with similar values like ""Test"" and ""Test-KDD"".
In the configuration for a Cluster Diagram I selected “Attribute” as criterion which will be used to display the diagram.
As Attribute, I selected the new/modified Attribute with the similar attribute values.
After that I select only the attribute value ""Test-KDD"". All other attribute values are deselect.
I confirm the selection und come to the next configuration page.
I the coloring settings now, I have the two attributes “Test-KDD” and “Test”.
I would expect only ""Test-KDD""

When I generate the diagram he has again only the selected attribute value (“Test-KDD”).
