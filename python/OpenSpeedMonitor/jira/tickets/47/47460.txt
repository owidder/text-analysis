Create context menu for selecting content type	"Create a context menu with a submenu that contains all available types for the content items.

attach it to the diagram.

call a (dummy) configuration class for each selection action.

read available options (list of types) from the (dummy) configuration class.

new menu is OK, no adaptation of existing context menu needed now. 
Technical debt is clear and OK for Wolfgang."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	03/Mar/15 4:53 PM	24/Mar/15 1:02 PM														"03/Mar/15 5:17 PM;wfr;could be quick, but we do not know now.
Research needed on:

How do we find out which (diagram) element was clicked?

Plan B: one (bigger) menu for all part of the diagram, that is content, axes, title, empty space...

Research: about 1 hour.
after that it is clear what solution can be used.

static context menu, 5 SP"	"12/Mar/15 10:58 AM;wfr;research result:
there is a way to find out which diagram element (panel, ...) was clicked.

still to do: find an easy way to determine which logical/structural part of the diagram was clicked, that is either one of the ax√≠s areas, or the content area, or outside.

looking good"	"19/Mar/15 2:51 PM;dasm;Verified

	What is type of data? Just data or something special?
	this.getOptions = function (data)

	Are these function for future because they return an empty option array? Why they are implemented different? Why not return [] for all?
	var allTableOptions = function () {
	var diagramTitleOptions = function (data) {
	var bothAxisesHeadersOptions = function (data) {
	var xAxisHeadersOptions = function (data) {
	var yAxisHeadersOptions = function (data) {
	
LSDMain.js
	There are some todo's (probably from Wolfgang) Are these todo's for the next sprints?
	There are some returns ""@return {*|HTMLElement}"". What / why is * in return?

LSDItemBuilder.js
	What does @param bo {?} mean? Nullable with no type? If yes, why nullable and why no type?
	this.buildContentItem = function (bo)
	this.buildAxisItem = function (bo) {

LSDTableBuilder
	There are some returns ""@return {*|HTMLElement}"". What / why is * in return?

	Please jsdoc it. At least the param object is not clear. Maybe there is better name for this param
	var applyLayout = function (object, newProperties) {
	
	drawItems-function
	There are some code parts looking like a magic. Could you please add some comment
	E.g. in yAxisGroups.forEach(function (g, rix)
	What are: g and rix?
		row: 2 + rix // why this?
