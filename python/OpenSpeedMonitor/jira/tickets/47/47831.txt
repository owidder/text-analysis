Problem with Date format in history initialization scripts 	"The parte of ""…TO_DATE('01-JAN-1970','DD-MON-YYYY')…"" for the history initialization in the scripts migrattion_iteraplan_340_to_500_oracle.sql and iteraplan_5.0_initialize_history_oracle.sql cause problems by a customer in Canada. 

The recommendation is to use NLS_DATE_FORMATs independent like DD/MM/YYYY.
