Design icons for views and diagram boxes	"This was discussed in skype and sent by e-mail:


We need: icons for types of building blocks
The existing icons are in the start screen, or online here: http://www.iteraplan.de/iteraplan_ee_release/start/start.do

-	Business domain – idea: rectangle divided in neat sections to categorize all kind of business-level things

-	Business process – idea: typical process chevron

-	Business unit – idea: symbol for an organizational unit in a org-chart

-	Product – no known/clear idea for existing symbol

-	Business function – idea: sheet of paper with a bent corner

-	Business object – idea: rounded rectangle as typical symbol for objects in other kinds of diagrams

-	Information system – idea: thing containing other (inner thing, typically business objects)

-	IS domain – idea as for business domain, but categorizing IS things

-	Interface – idea: double-sided arrow for data-exchange, similar to zig-zag-arrow symbol for remote connection

-	Architectural domain – idea as for business domain, only for technical component

-	Technical component – idea: similar to a stack of disks, or something in layers

-	Infrastructure element – idea: similar to a 90’s under-the-desk computer in “tower case”, something tangible

-	Project – matrix-like diagram of tasks and durations, similar to a Gantt chart


We have different kinds of icons and combinations:

-	Icon for a single building block, for example information system “SAP R/3 # v3.14”: 
o	Idea: Use basic icon
o	Other idea: use basic icon in a box to make it more “tangible” or “substantial” 
-	Icon for list of building blocks, for example: “all information systems” or “recently upgraded information systems”
o	Idea: combine basic icon with a list symbol
o	Other idea: use three basic icons staggered
-	Icon for a diagram with one main type, for example “information systems grouped by ISD”
o	Idea: combine icon for diagram type (see below) with main element type 

We need icons for diagrams, both as a “pure diagram” (without element type info) and a “diagram with elements of type X” 
The full list follows.
The existing iteraplan application has a page with these “symbols” for the diagram types, attachment diagram-overview, life here: http://www.iteraplan.de/iteraplan_ee_release/graphicalreporting/init.do?locale=en

-	Nesting Cluster
-	Cluster
-	Landscape
-	Info Flow
-	Portfolio
-	Masterplan
-	Pie
-	Chart
-	Pie/Chart combined
-	Dashboard

These very detailed and large “symbols” must be pared down and reduced to a real icon-like complexity.

We still need a few icons for other views or parts of the system, for example
-	Tutorial
-	Export of data 
-	Import of data
-	User management
-	General configuration

These views are less important at the moment, but you could give us icons for that as well.

"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	01/Oct/14 8:11 AM	08/Oct/14 5:20 PM														"06/Oct/14 10:23 AM;wfr;results so far as discussed last week:

* colors swatches by the dev team are OK for a designer's eye.
* idea for ""what exact value should this background color display?"": use small text/number badges in lower right corner of (inner) box, and in color legend.
** use one or two letters of value text, for example  l, m, h for low, medium, high
** open: one or two letters
** open: for no value: dash, icon or empty badge
** for number ranges: start of range in two digits, for example 4500 - 5000 as badge(45)
** open: or end of range? or midpoint?
