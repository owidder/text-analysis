"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	04/Mar/15 3:05 PM	07/Apr/15 1:28 PM														"25/Mar/15 2:22 PM;wfr;TODO WFr discuss with Andrii:

date attributes for axes are farer down the backlog.
So the menu should NOT show these attributes.

This ticket should be easier without date attributes

alternative: keep it in the ticket scope, and the code, but hide it by a hard coded feature switch.

TODO WFr: 
* discuss
* change ticket text
* add ticket for menu change
* refer to this ticket


Discussion with Andrii:
* reduce scope of this ticket: no date attributes (yet)
* create new ticket to add date attributes to the menu, later

Also discussed: attribute lists must be dynamic, not hard coded.
Reason: almost all attributes are user defined, and can be totally different from one installation (for client A) to another (for client B).

* I don't find a unit test in contextMenuProcessor-spec for the method ""getEnumAxisPropertyOptions"". Could you please add one or is it already existing?
* Why is function ""diagramTitleOptions"" (line 55) unused? Maybe no longer needed? Or preparation for later?"	"02/Apr/15 3:59 PM;msr;Please change the naming of the menu entries:
