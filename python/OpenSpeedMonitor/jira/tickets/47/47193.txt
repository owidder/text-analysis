Filter for inner boxes (date attributes)	"Follow-Up ticket to IPNINE-226

*Summary:*
Create a filter on elements for inner boxes of the Nesting Cluster Diagram. Filter options are *date attributes* of the elements. Filters must be implemented for all available *date* parameters. 

Note: only direct scalar Date attributes, not composite DateRange attrbibutes. The latter will be added in an extra ticket.

*As-Is:*
Inner Boxes can be filtered by status, complexity and last modification date.

*To-Be:*
Inner Boxes can be filtered by all available *date* attributes.

*Affected parts of the system:*
- Nesting cluster diagram
- context menu
- date picker

*Approach:* 
The values can be text type, enumeration (like in status), dates (like in ""last modification date) or numeric (like in costs). For this ticket only date attributes are in scope. The other 3 types follow in follow-up tickets. The date type uses actual solution (date range picker at top right corner).

The solution uses the metamodel information from the REST API.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user starts with the view of an open NCD with IS as inner elements.
The user opens the context menu for inner boxes with secondary click. 
In the menu, he hovers over ""Show with ..."" (Note: with ellipsis ""...""). 
A second level menu opens immediately on hover. 
The user clicks on ""modified in ..."" with primary click.
A date range picker opens immediately and is in focus.
The user selects a first date as lower bound.
The diagram is filtered immediately.
The user selects a second date as upper bound.
The diagram is filtered immediately.
The users does a primary click next to menu structure.
The menu structure disappears.
The date range picker stays on the screen.

The steps above must work with every *date* attribute defined for all building block types available for the inner boxes.
The steps must work starting with no filtering by attribute, or starting with an existing filtering by attribute.

Yes, the context menu should disappear, when user selects any filtering attribute. (Good idea) And the range slider/text input bar/date picker should appear immediately after selection of a filtering attribute. And they should all be on the same position in the screen.
2. Yes, the range slider/text input bar/date picker should show the last used data, only if this filter is active. The can change the active filter.
3. The range slider/text input bar/date picker appears only after selection of a filtering attribute. And it disappears with any other action."	02/Apr/15 1:20 PM;tam;We still need the Unit-Tests for the Date-Picker-Filter (but also for all other filters)	07/Apr/15 9:27 AM;tam;There is a bug in displaying of the directive	"09/Apr/15 2:42 PM;nle;*reproduce:
