why did you remove the drawLegend?
the drawDiagram looks like it consists of configuration stuff and drawing table and legend.
So maybe it's better to divide it in these parts?

17. What is actually p? Does it mean property or parameter? Could you jsdoc it?"	"02/Apr/15 9:35 AM;tam;lsdItemDecorator.js
I'm not sure, if we need a bit more jsDoc. On the one hand the code is understandable,but it's not really clear, why it's implemented like this
applyLayoutFunction - there are different implementations with different functions. maybe at least short what they are doing
collectValuesFunction - same here"
