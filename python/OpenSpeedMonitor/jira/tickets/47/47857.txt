Immediate elastic load	"Currently, loading the elastic data model is handled as follows:
* Each time when someone logs in, check whether there is an elastic model loaded for the current datasource
* If not, schedule an asynchronous load of the elastic model
* This load is executed within 10-15 seconds and can take a few seconds up to a few minutes, depending on model size
* Until the load is finished, accessing the elastic data nets no data at all, but also no error.

2 improvements:
* Instead of scheduling an elastic load, trigger one immediately if there is no data loaded for the current datasource
* When accessing elastic data and there is no loaded data present, wait for the current loading process to finish and use its result.

This way there will be less confusing behavior, especially of the new client, after iteraplan was restarted."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	24/Jun/15 2:15 PM	30/Jun/15 12:40 PM					elastic	load	ship-it-day							"30/Jun/15 12:40 PM;fam;Checked code and funktion.
