Incorrect saving of an interface with an inactive information system	"# Go to Administration => Configuration => and uncheck ""Elements with status 'Inactive' are shown"".
# Open an Interface and then one of its information systems
# Change the status of the selected informations system to ""inactive""
# Go back to the interface and edit it

The main issue
- *Actual:*
The modified Information System won't be on the list, but the first Information System from the list instead.
- *Expected:*
Also if the system of the interface is inactive, this should be displayed.

The consequent issue:
- *Actual:*
If you change for examle only the description of the interface, also the information system will be replaced by the first infromation system.
- *Expected:*
Changes on the description shouldn't cause changes on information system."		Bug	iteraplan PO	23/Jan/15 2:25 PM	28/Jan/15 2:10 PM
