Opening a Problem Report report link without admin perm shows http error 500	"When a ProblemReport download link has been created to be sent to an iteraplan administrator, and the link is sent to / opened by someone, who is NOT an administrator (= has not the role ""iteraplan_Supervisor""), then a Tomcat HTTP 500 error page  (or a blank page) is shown:

{code}
HTTP Status 500 - Could not resolve view with name 'miscellaneous/requestProblemReport' in servlet with name 'springmvc'
{code}

This is not really an error, because the mail should be sent to an administrator, but the 500 page is ugly an not very meaningful.

The problem is in line 99 of
_de.iteratec.iteraplan.presentation.dialog.Miscellaneous.MiscellaneousController.requestProblemReport()_
when plain ModelAndView() is returned."		Bug	iteraplan PO	23/Mar/15 11:02 AM	26/Mar/15 10:21 AM					problemreport									23/Mar/15 11:04 AM;fka;Should be something like "not authorized"
