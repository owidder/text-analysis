""a&nbsp;b"" matches ""a&nbsp;&nbsp;b"" should be symmetric, that is also ""a&nbsp;&nbsp;b"" matches ""a&nbsp;b"".

otherwise ""a&nbsp;&nbsp;b"" could never be matched by any ""a&nbsp;&nbsp;b"", ""a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b"", ""a&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;b""...

so _both_ sides must be normalized"	"04/May/15 5:46 PM;ach;- new common util removes multiple spaces in string
- use new method for applying the text filter. (""a       b"" matches ""a b"")
- use new method while processing ncd. (""a b"" matches ""a         b"")
Note: changes are for ncd only!"	"05/May/15 9:55 AM;fam;Code checked, function fixed.
