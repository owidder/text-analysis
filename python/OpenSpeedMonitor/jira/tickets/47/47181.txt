Rel2-2015: Filter by properties of connected elements of inner boxes	"Follow-Up on IPNINE-226.
*Summary:*
Create a filter on elements for inner boxes of the Nesting Cluster Diagram. Filter options are attributes of the directly connected elements. Filters must be implemented for all available parameters.

*As-Is:*
Inner Boxes can be filtered by status, complexity and last modification date of the element itself.

*To-Be:*
Inner Boxes can be filtered by all available attributes of any directly connected element.

*Affected parts of the system:*
- Nested cluster diagram
- context menu
- action bar near context menu
- text input bar
- date range picker

*Approach:* 
The values can be text, enumeration (like in status), dates (like in ""last modification date) or numeric (like in costs). For
- text type: text input bar
- enumeration type uses actual layout (2-level menu)
- date type uses actual solution (date range picker at top right corner)
- numeric type uses new ""range picker"" with open end in a new ""action bar"" ""near"" the context menu

Adapt context menu: Create a new entry on the first level (""Filter for connected ..."") and a new second level menu. On the second level all available directly connected Building Block Types are shown. On the third level the connected attributes are shown (see attached mockup). This mockup informs about positioning and content, it is no styleguide for the layout. Leave the current layout as is.

Special-case: Multi-value attributes: If an attribute has multiple values, this is not an issue for the simple filtering. If any of the values matches to the filtering, then the other values can be ignored.

The solution uses the metamodel information from the REST API.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user starts with the view of an open NCD with IS as inner elements.
The user opens the context menu for inner boxes with secondary click. 
In the menu, he hovers over ""Filter for connected ...""  (Note: with ellipsis ""...""). 
A second level menu opens immediately on hover. 
The user hovers over ""Technical component"".
A third level menu opens immediately on hover.
The user selects ""Status"".
A fourth level menu opens immediately on hover.
The user selects ""Current"".
The menu structure disappears.
The diagram is filtered immediately.

The steps above must work with every attribute defined for all directly connected building block types available for the inner boxes, and for every value of these attributes.
The steps must work starting with no filtering by attribute, or starting with an existing filtering by attribute."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	21/Nov/14 3:32 PM	20/Oct/15 9:07 AM					filter	nesting
