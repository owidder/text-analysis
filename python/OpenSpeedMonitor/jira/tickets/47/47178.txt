Load Test for History	"Test if the history feature has a negative impact on importing large datasets (as for E-104).

Use a regular iteraplan build (trunk). It is not necessary to use a E-104 customization.

1) 
Load database dump from E-104 to have the user defined attributes, 
export the data into Excel,
delete about half of the IS, (or less)
import the Excel.

2) 
Load DB dump,
export data into Excel
modify one column in IS sheet, for example, cost, with random values, or only for a part of the rows.
import the Excel.

Use your own discretion on how many elements to create or to write, so that the test case is realistic and meaningful.

Do with trial configuration (history enabled) and comparison configuration (history disabled)."		Task	iteraplan PO	18/Nov/14 10:00 AM	16/Dec/14 9:32 AM														"04/Dec/14 12:41 PM;sfe;Case 1 (essentially creation of about 2000 IS) may take quite a while even without history.
In case 2 there should not be an issue modifying values in a single attribute column for *all* IS, as past tests showed good performance for such a task."	05/Dec/14 12:03 PM;iteraplan;Maybe no longer necessary, talk to SFE/TDI	16/Dec/14 9:32 AM;isc;No longer necessary -> ticket is closed!
