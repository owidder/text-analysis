Add link to classic iteraplan start page to new client	"Imagine user Alice working with iteraplan's new client, navigating to the Information System overview list.
Now Alice decides she wants to do an Excel export.
For that, she has to navigate to the old client.

Currently, she can only navigate to one of the diagrams in the new client and from there to the according diagram in the old client. Then she can access the Export/Import page from the menu.
Alternatively she could change the URL in the browser's address bar accordingly.
Both options are user-unfriendly.

*Better*: Add a html link pointing to the start page of the old client. Display that link on every page of the new client, for example on the right of the header."
