All names for controll options (filtering, coloring, grouping, nesting and so on) should be displayed with the same wording in the Context menu for inner and outer elements and in the legend.

Also fix the similar issue in LSD (also related to type of status filtering)

Found a bunch of wrong ""name"" and ""persistentName"" uses. Also some string-lists found, that are still existing since prototyp stadium. Clarification should be done, if they are still necessary or can be removed.
As necessary changes affect many files that should be adjusted according the internationalization, too, this changes shall be done within the Internationalization-Ticket.

-categoryController.js 
-category-page.html
-fixedData.js
-service.coloringOptions.js
-queryAlias.js
-common.js
-all attributes list.txt
-service.diagramElementProcessor.js
