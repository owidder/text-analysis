Currently, we have two arrays for highlighting:
# “{{highlightedItems}}”: this array contains all elements, which were selected over the option “Highlight this item”
# “{{modificationDateRangeHightlight}}”: this array contains the date range in this the elements/items should be highlighted.

To detect these elements, which are in the chosen date range but should not be selected, I have created a third array: {{dateRangeExclusions}}


h6. A few words about the other changes:
* If you change the date range, the array {{ dateRangeExclusions}} should be cleared. You choose a new data, thus re-select all items in this range.
* You have an elemen/item which you have selected first over “highlight this item” and it is highlighted over a date range and you will remove it, it should removed from both arrays. 
* Outer elements should not be affected by the changes.
