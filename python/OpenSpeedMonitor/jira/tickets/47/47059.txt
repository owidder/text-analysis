Minimize with google closure	"Combine all custom JS code (not the libs) into a minized file, using Google closure.

In index.html include only the minimized JS (and the libs).
Add index-dev.html that included the original readable JS.

Design and build a build process that minimizes and builds a variant of the app (in a target folder?) with only the minimized variants, but without the original, readable JS files, and all other resources of course.
This variant must be ready to be copied into a Tomcat.

Background: We want to make a ""officially published"" demo variant, so that the users should not see the original JS code.

Real obfuscation, more than minimizing with closure, is out of scope of this ticket. "		New Feature	iteraplan PO	16/Oct/14 4:43 PM	25/Nov/14 12:44 PM														"17/Oct/14 11:19 AM;wfr;call with Sergii

please take closure, its proven and it runs on java platform, which will run on build server Jenkins/Hudson
