Context menu improvements 	"Improve the context menu shown on the left hand side with almost all pages in the application

The two items ""open elements"" and ""watched elements"" should both show the number of entries in the title. Put the number at front, e.g.""5 watched elements"".

Whenever the number is zero, the user should not be able to expand the element. Remove the down arrow in this case.

The default state when opening a page should be as it is currently: ""Open elements"" is expanded, ""watched elements"" is collapsed.

The third, top element ""Context action"" should not be changed at all.
