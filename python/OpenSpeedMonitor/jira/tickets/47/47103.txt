Information Flow Diagram	"+++++++++++++++++
POSTPONED AFTER APRIL 2015
+++++++++++++++++


Add a new diagram type to the new client that duplicates/replaces the existing Information Flow Diagram.

For existing configuration see: http://www.iteraplan.de/iteraplan_ee_release/show/graphicalreporting/informationflowdiagram 

For a visual example, see : http://www.iteraplan.de/iteraplan_ee_release/show/fastexport/generateSavedQuery.do?id=1&amp;savedQueryType=reports_export_graphical_InformationFlow&amp;outputMode=attachment


The core features are:
* use a selection of information systems from the list view, that is use the filter settings
* modify the filter settings interactively in the diagram
* use a selection of interfaces, that is use the filter settings of a list view of interfaces
* modify the filter settings for interfaces interactively in the diagram
* use a selection of business objects, that is use the filter settings of a list view of business objects
* modify the filter settings for business objects interactively in the diagram
* to be decided: are there two different BO filters for the BOSs *contained* in the IS and the BOs as *labels* on the IF edges?
* define and modify a selection of IS as placed in the start zone, that is the left hand side of the diagram
* define and modify a selection of IS for the end zone, that is right hand side
* the diagram must be layed out without start and end zone selection, too.
* start/end zone selection is by (context) menu action, and by drag and drop
* within the start/end zone there the vertical order is to be preserved
* color IS boxes by a property, both discrete and continuous, or use default colors
* select line type (dashed, solid, points, ...) by a property, or use solid
* use a combination of these propertiies as edge labels, names of names of BOs of the Interface, list of names of the TCs of the interface, name of IF, description, other property of the interface 
* legend for coloring, line type, line label
* HARD: layout nodes and edges, so that they respect the constraints (start/end zone) with grid-parallel connectors (??? or B-splines?))), that nodes and edges are spaced evenly, that edges do not intersect more than needed, that edges are connected at the neares side of the node
* export as PDF, PNG, SVG, Visio

Not in the scope of the new diagram:
* use a diagram (exported before and imported now) as the starting point for the layout of the new diagram.
* create a diagram of connected elements of different types, for example business process connected by commonly supporting IS."		Epic	iteraplan PO	30/Oct/14 1:09 PM	30/Dec/15 12:09 PM
