New Client: Exception handling	"*Summary:*
Implement a basic exception handling with a rudimentary error message and a log report.

*As-Is:*
There exists no exception handling.

*To-Be:*
Catch and handle all major exceptions with small effort. Create a rudimentary error message and a log report.

*Affected parts of the system:*
New client:
* All parts of the system

If you have any questions, please contact WFR or MSR.

*Unsorted Notes*
* this is closely related to the logging ticket 2893. 
** fully functional only if a log-to-server is in place and working
** can be started before log-to-server,working with injected $log.error()
* catch exceptions on the ""outermost"" points of the applicatoin code. this means in all entry points of the application functions that are called from the framework.
* in the applicatoin code itself, do _not_ raise exceptions, but log problems and continue with some default behavior. => only ""unexpected exceptions"" need to be handled
* write half a wiki page of guidelines with examples
* add exception handling to 80 percent of all application code.

simply said: Replace standard angular exception handler with our own.

The $exceptionhandler also calls $log.error if not overriden, so probably also here it's enough just to prepare a message."	19/May/15 7:00 PM;tam;Created new ticket for possible improvements ITERAPLAN-3181
