New logo for iteraplan	"Create a new logo for iteraplan.

Starting with the existing (modernized) wordmark, simplify the design.
For example, the new logo could be 
* ""ip"" with a black ""i"" and an iteragenta ""p""
* a highly stylized diagram
* a highly stylized, simplified start screen (from the old client)
* anything else

Note: the ideas above are just that, ideas. 

Make 3 different variants for the first discussion.
