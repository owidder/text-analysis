Filter for outer boxes	"Analogue ticket to IPNINE-226 for outer boxes. Reuse code of inner box filtering.

*Summary:*
Create a filter on elements for outer boxes of the Nesting Cluster Diagram. Filter options are attributes of the elements. Filters must be implemented for all available parameters

*As-Is:*
Outer boxes cannot be filtered.

*To-Be:*
Outer Boxes can be filtered by all available attributes (incl. dates).

*Affected parts of the system:*
- Nesting cluster diagram
- context menu
- action bar near context menu
- text input bar
- date range picker

*Approach:* 
The values can be text, enumeration (like in status), dates (like in ""last modification date) or numeric (like in costs). For
- text type: text input bar
- enumeration type uses actual layout (2-level menu)
- date type uses actual solution (date range picker at top right corner)
- numeric type uses new ""range picker"" with open end in a new ""action bar"" ""near"" the context menu

Adapt context menu for outer boxes accordingly.

Special-case: Multi-value attributes: If an attribute has multiple values, this is not an issue for the simple filtering. If any of the values matches to the filtering, then the other values can be ignored.

The solution uses the metamodel information from the REST API.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user starts with the view of an open NCD with IS as inner elements.
The user opens the context menu for outer boxes with secondary click. 
In the menu, he hovers over ""Show with ..."" (Note: with ellipsis ""...""). 
A second level menu opens immediately on hover. 
The user hovers over ""State of Health"".
A third level menu opens immediately on hover.
The user selects ""Good"".
The menu structure disappears.
The diagram is filtered immediately.

The steps above must work with every attribute defined for all building block types available for the outer boxes, and for every value of these attributes.
The steps must work starting with no filtering by attribute, or starting with an existing filtering by attribute.
