notes: also tested on released public demo"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	08/May/15 3:08 PM	19/Jan/16 1:56 PM					coloring	error	ncd							"12/May/15 1:22 PM;ach;- error output caused by {{var type = (item.type === 'inner') ? 1 : 0;}} in {{controller.ncd.js}} ({{item}} is undefined)
- {{$scope.colorScheme}} contains old color value for picked element
- after discussion with _anma_: the trouble is probably caused by third party _bootstrap-colorpicker_  "
