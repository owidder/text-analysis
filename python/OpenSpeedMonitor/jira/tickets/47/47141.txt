Jenkins job "test_performance" fails	"Jenkins job ""test_performance"" fails since October 31st.
Before that it seems the results were not correct either, for some time, as the import for trunk was reported to last only few seconds.

I suspect the changes to asynchronous import processes are at least part of the reason.

Please investigate why the job fails and fix it. Make sure it shows plausible numbers for trunk."		Bug	iteraplan PO	05/Nov/14 3:59 PM	17/Nov/14 4:08 PM					jenkins	performance	test							"17/Nov/14 4:07 PM;fam;Code adjustment okey.
