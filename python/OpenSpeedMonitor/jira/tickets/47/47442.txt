Changing date using keyboard doesn't work properly	"Changing date using keyboard and not the date picker widget doesn't work properly.

Everytime user changes a single character in a date, the date input field loses the focus.

The only way to change other characters is to click the date input field again for every single change.

Steps to reproduce:
- Select for example an information system and press ""Edit""
- Click the productive date field and start to change the date using keyboard"		Bug	iteraplan PO	24/Feb/15 2:35 PM	02/Mar/15 11:25 AM					gui
