Min/max-value in continuous coloring depending on actual filtering	"*Summary:*

Add a minium and a maximum value in continuous coloring.



*As-Is:*

At the moment the min and max values are independet of the actual filtering.



*To-Be:*

For numeric attributes the minimum and maximum value are calculated individually depending on the actual highest and lowest value of the actual shown attributes values in the actual selection/filtering. The legend and continuous coloring uses these calculated values as upper and lower limit.



*Acceptance Criteria:*

The user opens a Nesting Cluster Diagram and selects coloring by cost. The maximum value of the costs is shown in red as upper limit, the minimum value in green as lower limit and all other values in between. The user filters his selection of inner elements. The coloring and legend is immediately updated accordingly with the new highest and lowest value.

More generally, for any numeric attribute and any filtering the coloring and legend gets updated."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	04/Nov/14 8:36 AM						color									"14/Sep/15 1:28 PM;sfe;Should be optional. Regular case is still absolute color range.
