Yes, that's ok because there istÂ´no plural value (see also isr2bo or tcr2ie), but constructor need both values, so we use singular instead of null.

An improvement ticket was created ITERAPLAN-2900

Done.


{quote}-The new schema of structured type relations is currently not documented, as there will come some more changes. But, is any other documentation done, e.g. about the new attributable relations?{quote}
Because the chages and new relation are similar to isr2bo or tcr2ie documentation was short with references to the old relations.
The most important notes were done with http://www.iteraplan.de/issues/browse/ITERAPLAN-2856"	26/Jan/15 10:00 AM;fam;Checked solutions and it's all okey
