All Building Block types as axes elements, without menu	"*Summary:*
Implement all Building Block types as axis elements.

everything BUT not the context menu, see 374

*As-Is:*
Only default axis elements exist as axis elements.

*To-Be:*
All Building Block types can be selected as axis elements.

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Landscape diagram

*Approach:* 
The building block type of the axis elements can be changed via the context menu entry ""Change row association"" or ""Change column association"" (to be created). Only direct connected building block types are offered as column or row association.

*Acceptance Criteria:*
The user opens the landscape diagram with Information System as inner and Technical Component and Infrastructure Elements as axis elements.
The user uses secondary click on a Technical Component.
The context menu opens immediately.
The user selects ""Change column association"".
All direct connected Building Block types are offered in a second level context menu, i.e. Interface, Information System Domain, Business Object, Business Function, Project, Business Process, Business Unit and Product.
The user selects Business Object.
The context menu disappears immediately and the diagram is updated accordingly.

This works for all possible elements independently of any filtering, coloring, etc. "		New Feature	iteraplan PO	26/Jan/15 9:05 AM	07/Apr/15 1:28 PM					axis	buildingblock	landscape							24/Mar/15 1:20 PM;sepr;Is dependent from IPNINE-374	"01/Apr/15 12:20 PM;dasm;Verified
