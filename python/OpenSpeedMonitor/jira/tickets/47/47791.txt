NCD: Implement correct behaviour for numeric filters	"*Summary:*

Implement correct behaviour of numeric filters:



* If you select a numeric filter again from the context menu, a range slider opens. The range slider AND the legend show both the values of previous selected values. This works independetly if you select any other filter in between or not.



*Timebox: 2 PD*



Timebound: If this solutions is technically difficult/not possible, discuss with [~wfr] to deactivate the second click on this numeric filter.



*Acceptance Criteria:*

*The user opens the Nested Cluster Diagram.

* The user filters by Strategic value 2-10.

* The user filters by current type of status.

* The user selects again Strategic value in the context menu.

* The range slider still shows the range 2-10 and the legend still shows strategic value 2-10.

"		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/May/15 3:12 PM	14/Sep/15 4:34 PM														"13/Aug/15 4:20 PM;fro;- updated ng-slider to newest version (new name is angular-awesome-slider) 

- tried https://github.com/darul75/angular-awesome-slider/issues/96 solution (invert changing value and options)

-> http://jsfiddle.net/z4eugwo7/1/ shows the bug pretty good 

---> change value button works, if you dont touch the slider before you click



- the slider wont show the correct value, even if ""slvalue"" is set correctly

- debugged the angular-awesome-slider.js (especially .set() and ._set())

-> Strategic Value -> Costs : works (awesome-slider.js runs an init() function)

-> Strategic Value -> change slider -> Costs : dont work  (no init() function call)
