Unify clicks and menus in list view	"Unify the way the user works with clicks and menus, both technically and on the UI/UX level.
In this ticket, refactor the list view  only.
There will be other tickets on the home screen, the single item view and the diagram view.

For background on the to-be concept of all gestures and actions, see http://www.iteraplan.de/wiki/display/IPNINE/Clicks+And+Menus
Warning: this page is still under construction.

Technical idea:

The actions on a element (tile, row, cell, column header) should be defined in a  definition.
This definition is used for
* the actions in the menu bar (if the element is selected)
* the items of the context menu
* the handler for double click

The definition of this action should be used both for the rendering of the menus and for the execution of the actions.

The main goal is: 
if we add an action to a element, it should be available in all the places, that is menu bar actions, context menu, and shortcut gestures.
