Create partial skeleton of LSD with simple static dummy diagram	"Create a skeleton implementation of the LSD with a go.js diagram and all JS classes that displays only a title and a simple dummy diagram of one text rectangle.

Details:
* Create the JS class ""LSD main class"" (C) (all component/class names as in the ""design notes on Landscape diagram"" page - all letters come from this wiki-page)
* call the LSD main class (C) from the LSD main controller (A)
* create the JS class ""LSD diagram configuration class"" (D)
*  call the LSD diagram configuration class (D) from the LSD main class (C)
* the LSD diagram configuration class (D) creates a go.js Diagram with
 ** a static title
 ** a static rectangle with static text and colored background
 ** not yet: node template
* create the JS class ""LSD diagram renderer"" (H)
* pass the Diagram from the LSD diagram configuration class (D)
* let the renderer display the diagram in the LSD html template. (B)

* create skeletons for Jasmine unit tests for all new JS classes, that is
 ** LSD main class (C)
 ** LSD diagram config (D)
 ** LSD diagram renderer (H)
* the unit test skeletons must have at least one simple test case for construction of a new instance of the class under test. More test cases later

More functions will be added soon..."	47318	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	26/Feb/15 2:56 PM	11/Mar/15 4:43 PM														"11/Mar/15 4:43 PM;wfr;Basic LSD ticket now split in a different way.
