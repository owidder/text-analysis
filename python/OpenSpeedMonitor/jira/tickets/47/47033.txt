Import deletes values of date attributes when they are invalid in imported file	"_Reproduce:_
# Download Excel Data on iteraplan's Import/Export page
# Change the (existing) value of a date attribute for some information system to '-1' in the Excel file
# Import file with 'conservative' or 'overwrite' strategy

_Expected:_ Warning that value is invalid and will be ignored. No changes on import
_Actual:_ Warning appears, but the information system is changed on import, the date value is unset."
