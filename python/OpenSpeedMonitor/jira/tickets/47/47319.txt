Sprint 6? Use consistent terms: "nested cluster diagram", "nest" and "cluster"	"*Summary:*
Use always the term ""nested cluster"" instead of ""nesting cluster"".

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Head of Nesting Cluster page
* Building Block Type Liste Header: ""Show nested cluster diagram""
* and so on

Use the term ""cluster"" for the outer-to-inner relationship
* for example ""Cluster Information Systems"" changes the type of the inner boxes to IS
* for example ""Cluster by Business Processes"" changes the type of the outer boxes to BP

Use the term ""nest"" for the outer-to-outer and inner-to-inner relationship
* for example ""Nest by parent"" sets the self-relationship to the parent-direction of the parent/child self-relationship
* in the context menu, the action is ""Nest by"" and affects the outer or inner element, depending on the element clicked.
* if the action is outside of the context menu, it is ""Nest outer elements by"" or ""Nest inner elements by"", respectively.

Note that the terminology must be used in all places consistently, including
* menu and other actions
* generated diagram titles
* legend
* sample data, pre-defined diagrams
