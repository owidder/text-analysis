Actual: Range picker blocks title
Expected: What is the expected behavior?"		Bug	iteraplan PO	06/Feb/15 12:20 PM	30/Jul/15 2:30 PM														"15/Apr/15 10:35 AM;wfr;Recommendation: defer

because title is only temporarily blocked (really?)
and title is not essential for the current task

think of a layout with minimal blocked elements in general
as the first step of fixing this issue"	30/Jul/15 2:30 PM;msr;The overlapping by the range slider is not a perfect behaviour, but just temporary during filter selection. Afterwards the range slider disappears again.
