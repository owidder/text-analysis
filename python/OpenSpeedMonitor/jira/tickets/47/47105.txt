Random test failure	"The test {{de.iteratec.iteraplan.businesslogic.service.FastExportServiceImplTest.testGetEncompassingRuntimePeriodNoStartNoEnd}} shows non-deterministic behavior, sometimes failing, sometimes not.
Example for a failing run: [Jenkins {{nightly_builder_hsqldb_EE_3.x}}, run #1773|https://iteraplan.iteratec.de/hudson/job/nightly_builder_hsqldb_EE_3.x/1773/]

Please investigate the reason for the random fails and fix it."		Bug	iteraplan PO	03/Nov/14 9:30 AM	04/Nov/14 12:25 PM					test									"03/Nov/14 10:53 AM;gph;Two different instances of RuntimePeriod are compared by their start and end Dates for equality.

Date objects are compared by their time value in milliseconds, whereas Date's ""toString()"" methods produces a String without the millisesond value (only seconds are shown). Therefore the error message shows the ""same"" date values, while the real value (in milliseconds) might not be equal.

This behaviour could be reproduced in Eclipse: Sometimes the error occurs (when the Dates' values are *not* equal) in the test method ""testGetEncompassingRuntimePeriodNoStartNoEnd()"", sometime it doesn't (when the Dates' values in milliseconds are equal).

This error may occur in all test methods ""testGetEncompassingRuntimePeriod...()"" inside FastExportServiceImplTest."
