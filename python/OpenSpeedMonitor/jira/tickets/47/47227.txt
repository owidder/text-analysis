All Building Block types as outer elements	"Analogue story to IPNINE-224 (now for outer elements):
*Requested by new client B-108 and FKA:*

*Summary:*
For the existing implementation of the Nesting Cluster Diagram, add the function to use all types of building blocks as outer elements.

*As-Is:*
Information System Domain and Business Object are available as outer element of the Nesting Cluster Diagram.

*To-be:*
All standalone Building Block Types are available as outer elements. But no connections are necessary, i.e. only use default inner type. The connections will be implemented with follow-up tickets.

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Nesting Cluster Diagram
* Inner boxes
* Outer boxes
* Context menu
* Menu bar (Wolfgang: deferred until we have concept for the menu bar actions. Will be extra ticket)

*UI:*
In the NCD view, add actions (in context menu and in menu bar) to switch to a different building block type for the outer element.

*Diagram:*
Structure of the diagram unchanged, but different content.

List of all outer elements and their default inner element:
The inner types are all direct one-step-connections without any attributes on the relationship.

* Information System Domain (existing) - Information System
* Business Object (existing) - Business Function
* Architectural Domain - Technical Component
* Technical Component - Information System
* Infrastructure Element - Information System
* Interface - Technical Component
* Information System - Technical Component
* Business Function - Information System
* Project - Information System
* Product - Business Domain
* Business Unit - Business Domain
* Business Process - Business Domain
* Business Domain - Business Object

*Acceptance criteria:*
The user is starting with a Nesting Cluster Diagram (inner element: IS, outer element: ISD)
The user opens with secondary click the context menu of an outer element.
The user hovers over ""Change outer element"".
On the second level a list of available Building Block opens immediately.
The user selects ""Project"".
The context menu structure disappears immediately.
The diagram is updated immediately: All inner elements are still Information Systems. The outer type is now Project.
The users clicks on the button ""Change outer element"" in the menu bar.
A list of available Building Block Types opens immediately.
The user selects ""Information System Domain"" with primary click.
The menu structure disappears immediately.
The diagram is updated immediately: All outer elements are now Information System Domains. Information Systems are still the inner elements.
More general: in every NCD with outer element type X, the user can switch to any other element type Y.
For each type Y, the NCD will have the specified default inner type intially.
When switching the outer type, the inner type is unchanged if it is connected to the new inner type."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	04/Dec/14 1:23 PM	23/Jan/15 2:30 PM					buildingblock	nesting								"23/Jan/15 2:30 PM;dasm;Verified (revision 538)
some part of this functionality (about Reset of all already applied coloring/filtering options on outer type is changed) has been implemented by Andrey under Story IP9-217 (see your 2nd comment )"
