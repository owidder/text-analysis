Colors review

Please review the colors that we use in the system for “logical” things (as opposed to “functional” colors for warning, default button and so on.)

In the nesting cluster diagram, we have
-	Discrete coloring for values in “good, medium, bad” = “green, yellow, red”. Please review, should be OK.
-	Continuous coloring (in 10 discrete steps or bands): values from low to high as “green to red” or “light to dark (blue)”, or vice versa.

For all colors, discrete and continuous:
-	The colors should be visually appealing in _color_ on the screen and printed
-	Less important, and not easy: the colors should be visually distinguishable in a black and white (greyscale) print. 
-	Very hard: how to keep the “no value”-grey different from a “some value in between” of a swatch?
-	Note that the greys should _not_ be _easy_ to keep apart, because this is simply not possible in greyscale, but they must not be completely different, so that one can see the difference if on holds the color legend next to box.
