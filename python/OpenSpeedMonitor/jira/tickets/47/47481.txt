add submenus for filter on axis elements	"DEPENDS on IPNINE-379
Fully reuse and implementation of the same filter types as for content items with controls etc.
=====================

add to the context menu two (identical) submenus

submenus can be reused from filter on content elements

estimated effort allocated to these tickets.

*Summary:*
Create a filter for axes elements.

*As-Is:*
There exists no filtering for axes elements.

*To-Be:*
Axes elements (if they are building block types and no attributes) can be filtered by enumeration, numeric, text or date attributes. Furthermore the axes elements can be filtered by attributes directly connected building block types (1-step connections) and by attributes of self-related building block types (self-relationship). For example:
Technical Component as axis element can be filtered by attributes of Technical Components
OR Technical Component as axis element can be filtered by attributes of Architectural Domains (e.g.)
OR Technical Component as axis element can be filtered by attributes of successor Technical Components (e.g.)
Please see the classical iteraplan system for concrete specification.

*Affected parts of the system:*
* Landscape diagram

*Approach:* 
Use the same context menu actions (""Show with ...""), the same logic, same url and the same legend. Filtering is only available, if an axis element is a Building Block."	21/Apr/15 4:49 PM;dasm;Verified (rev 983)	"22/Apr/15 1:45 PM;tam;*LSDConfiguration.js*
{code}LSDConfiguration.prototype.getAxisFilter{code}
""Collect X axis element filters to an Object""
either function description is not quite right or the signature
jsdoc is not complete

*lsdDataService.js*
{code}LSDDataService.prototype.setFilterFunction{code}
jsdoc should be modified and completed. It's not the getter anymore. A bit more comments to parameter
What are filterArrays?
What is filteringContent?
Optional: What is filterdefinition? Is it really of type Object? Or is there a type for this?

{code}LSDDataService.prototype.getTypeNameByFieldName{code}
please comment why we do stuff in the while loop. why is it neccessary to replace * with 1.
I don't understand it at first look

*lsdContextMenuProcessor.js*
{code}var getEnumerationFilterOptions{code}
{code}var getEnumerationFilterBySelfRelationOptions{code}
Fix the jsDoc since incomplete after refactoring or adding
Some parts of both functions seems to have similar code. Maybe a reason for some refactoring"
