NCD: Wrong behavior with empty Text input bar (filtering by text attributes)	"IP9-234

Summary: When user clicks on ""Search"" button without any entered keyword - setting line disappears from legend and previous filtering is canceling automatically

Steps to reproduce: 
1. go to NCD page
2. Use filtering by ""Name"" text attribute
3. Enter any system's name from current diagram and make filtering
4. Remove used keyword
5. Click on ""Search"" button
Actual: setting line disappears from legend and previous filtering is canceling automatically
Expected: Empty Text input bar shouldn't cancel previous filtering options. Should be impossible to make filtering without keyword

ASK Daria to write a concrete description with conrete, literal values like ""Enter 'SAP' in search text input field"" and so on
OR reproduce yourself

Then decide"	"15/Apr/15 2:40 PM;msr;This ticket is about: entering an empty string cancels all filtering.
No unexpteced behaviour."
