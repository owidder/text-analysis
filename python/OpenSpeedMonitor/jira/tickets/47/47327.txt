Copyright notice -> 2015	"Change the year in the copyright notice to 2015:
iteraplan footer on every page
header of all source code files
maybe somewhere else ;-)"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	26/Jan/15 2:36 PM	27/Jan/15 1:57 PM					copyright									"27/Jan/15 1:42 PM;isc;I have updated the year of the copyright notice in the:
* README Template
* iteraplan footer (in the property files )
* and in the licence.txt files for the following projects:
** common-base
** iteraplan
** elastic-4.1-light

In agreement with SFE, I have not updated the header of all source code files. This is done au-tomatically with the next release and was prepared with the changes in the license.txt files.
No changes I have made in the project SpringScurityExtensions!
This project should be integrated into iteraplan (ITERAPLAN-2517). With the next release the license text is also automatically updated.
