Wrong result for filtering by "last modification user" text attribute	"IP9-234

Use IS as outer type
Use Interface as inner type

Steps to reproduce:
1. Make any changes in the, for example, name of any interfaces system in Classic Client
2. In the New Client use filtering by ""last modification user"" text attribute
3. Input ""system"" as last modification user
Actual: No result
Expected: User should get system which was modified by him"		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/Feb/15 3:35 PM	18/Mar/15 3:19 PM														"11/Mar/15 9:42 AM;wfr;moved to iteraplan main project

Also did the same modification in other filter*Templates
