This leads to a diagram, even exported, with a wrong legend.
So the diagram may be misleading and causing massive financial damage if major business decisions are based on said faulty diagram.

AGAIN
analyze the signalling and control flow and update/refresh mechanism between these two views of the filter setting (model).

"	23/Apr/15 11:40 AM;fka;"Disconnet" between slider position and displayed numeric values below	"24/Apr/15 6:56 PM;tam;The bug still exists, but it only occurs after selecting numeric filter after another one.
If you select first numeric filter, then the for example a text filter and then the numeric filter again slider ends will be displayed correct.

Probably a bug in the slider or some magic in the angular we don't know about.
I sent an email and the bug report to the developer https://github.com/darul75/ng-slider/issues/96

Also a new improvement ticket was created ITERAPLAN-3130"
