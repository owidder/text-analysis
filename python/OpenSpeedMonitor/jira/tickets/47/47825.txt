Relationship distrigation	"For a hierarchical building block type (for example IS), distribute or aggregate connections to building blocks of lower or higher levels in the hierarchy, respectively.

Use these computed connections in NCD, LSD, MPD and IFD, and only for content elements. 



Distrigate only along the parent-child relationship (PCR). Do not distrigate PCR itself. Aggregate PCR upwards cumulative and&or distribute cumulative PCR downwards.



[Two border levels should be configurable idependently. Level x, i.e. all level 0 to x-1 PCRs are distributed downwards cumulative to level x and/or level y i.e. level infinite to level y+1 are aggregated upwards to level y. Distrigation should only be available when a level filter has been set previously. When a previously set level filter is cleared, the distrigation(s) are automatically removed, too.]



Save within the diagram configuration.

Everything in New Client only.



Caution: make sure that an aggregated or distributed self-relation on a type, might have unusual semantics and might not be a hierarchy. Consder excluding these cases if they cannot be explained to a human user.



Note that distrigation is an implicit effect caused by excluding elements by hierarchy level. There is no extra switch for distrigation, nor extra level controls."
