Hello Alex,

 

we changed the template code for Datepicker (dateRangeFilter/template.html) a bit by removing

                   data-max-date=""{{rangesFrom[1]}}""

                   data-min-date=""{{rangesFrom[0]}}""

 

and

                   data-max-date=""{{rangesTo[1]}}""

                   data-min-date=""{{rangesTo[0]}}""

 

from it.

 

Hope, it’s ok for you and don’t break you code.

 

So long,

Timur
