Allow upload and usage of .xlsm files as spreadsheet report Excel templates	"According to this [post|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/18350178/write-to-xlsm-excel-2007-using-apache-poi], it is possible to open .xlsm files with macros in Apache POI, to change the workbook, and to output the resulting file while preserving the macros.

Please add the possibility to upload .xlsm files on the iteraplan document templates page, and the usage of these in spreadsheet reports with Excel output format.

*Note:*
* Do not treat .xlsm files as a different Excel format, meaning they should be uploaded using the same dialog and to the same place as .xlsx files, and be offered as templates next to .xlsx templates.
* However, the resulting downloaded file has to have the proper file extension."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	18/May/15 1:55 PM	19/Jan/16 1:56 PM					Excel	report	spreadsheet
