Installer should incorporate pre-defined authentication settings	"Some customers with customized installers provide authentication settings to be included in the installer.
Currently this is done by using a predefined iteraplan-auth.properties file, disregarding the input for i.e. LDAP configuration during the installation process.
However, the configuration page still appears during the installation.
This can be confusing and is less than elegant.

Better:
If existing, the predefined iteraplan-auth.properties file (or a file created from it during building of the installer) provides preallocated values for the configuration page during the installation process."
