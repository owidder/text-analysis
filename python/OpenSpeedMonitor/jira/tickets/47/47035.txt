Error Messages during Import	"The following steps are made:

# Choose *no* file for upload
# Press upload button

Expected behavior: An appropriate error message is shown. If user selects a file and presses the upload-button again, the previous error message disappears and the usual upload-message is shown. 

Actual behavior: the error message remains and the upload message appears underneath. If user tries to start an upload without selecting an upload file again, no error message is shown at all. 

Another case:

# Choose a file for upload
# Delete the name of the file from the input box

Expected behavior: An appropriate error message is shown (file is missing or similar)

Actual behavior: iteraplan starts an import with the file which has been selected.
