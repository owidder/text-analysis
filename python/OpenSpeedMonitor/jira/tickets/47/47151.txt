Analyze incompatibilities between iteraplan and IE11	Aside from known issues, please check where iteraplan might experience issues when used with IE11, document in this issue and create sub-tasks to fix found issues within ITERAPLAN-2809.	47147	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	07/Nov/14 1:46 PM	12/Jan/15 4:42 PM														"10/Nov/14 12:35 PM;abo;See iterahub for hints for compatibility checks: https://iterahub.iteratec.de/iterahub/#/thread/342

1.
Governance => Roles and Permissions
	* Select a role 
	* Press edit
	* Select permissions tab
	* In the ""permission to edit building block types"" part (un)check any checkbox
		=> In the ""functional permissions"" part all items in both lists will be selected
		FireFox and Chrome are ok
	* In the ""functional permissions"" part press one of the arrows
		=> It's possible to press the arrow button also if no item is selected
		=> All items will be moved in other list either if no items or any items are selected
		FireFox and Chrome are ok

2.
Visualizations => Dashboard
	=> No diagrams are visible


Non-IE bug:
Governance => Supporting Queries
	1. login with a user who has permissions to run supporting queries in one browser (doesn't matter which one)
	2. login with another user who has permissions to run supporting queries in another browser (doesn't matter which one)
	3. Select the building block type or functional permission from one of the list bellow in the second browser 
	4. Run a supporting queries
	5. Select the different building block type or functional permission from one of the list bellow in the first browser 
	6. Run a supporting queries
	=> The selection from the second browser (steps 3 and 4) will be used for the query.
	=> This behaviour doesn't depend of browser or user. The selection seems to be stored globally
	Wolfgang says we'll fix it, if we have time because this is not critical.
	=> the same behaviour seems to be in parametrized consistency checks (Governance => Consistency checks). Selected parameters will be taken from the second browser (or user with newest session)

###

Small IE and non-IE things, but not really bugs

1.
IS => Visualizations => Content => Neighborhood Diagram
	* Two scrollbars
	* A Tooltip which is almost hidden occurs sometimes (same in Chrome, but there is no tooltip in FireFox)

2.	
Mass Updates => Export/Import
	=> There is an inactive input field for the file path
	=> ""Durchsuchen"" button looks like inactive
	=> This part of screen looks different in all browsers

3.
Governance => User Management / User Group Management / Roles and Permissions
	* Select a user / user group / role
	* Select the tab ""permission summaries""
	* Click more => Link
	The link in the input field looks like
	https://localhost:8443/iteraplan/show/user/11?undefined
	
	instead of 
	https://localhost:8443/iteraplan/show/user/11?activeTab=xxx
	
	The link above input field looks always https://localhost:8443/iteraplan/show/user/11
	
4.
Probably a common strange bug:
EA Data => Information Systems
	* Select an IS and press ""edit""
	* Select tab relations
	* Press any ""<="" in ""Business Mapping"". Root item ""-"" will be moved to the list of Available elements
	The same behavior in IE11, Chrome and FireFox

5.	
EA Data => Information Systems
	* Select an IS and press ""edit""
	=> Slight changes on GUI are visible
	   IE11 and Chrome
	=>  ""Status"" field has the old look
	   All browsers"	"09/Jan/15 10:18 AM;tam;Added two new Sub-Tasks for IE-Bugs:
