Add all remaining features to the NCD.

Remaining features are 
* those present in the traditional Web UI and missing in the new client.
* new in the new client, but not yet available in all expected places, or not yet working in combination.

Examples, *not* limited to this list:
 * all types of building blocks as inner elements
 * all connections and (connected) types for grouping (all predefined) and outer elements.
 * use two- and three-step connections for grouping  (all predefined / precomputed)
 * coloring inner elements by all properties (predefined and user defined)
 * coloring outer element by all properties, dito
 * filter on elements for outer boxes
 * partial diagram (left upper corner) for large number of elements
 * saving *all* view state in URL, including highlight, exclusion, order of elements, with compact/encoded parameter
 * extra group for ""orphans"", inner elements without an outer element
 * nesting for outer boxes
 * 3-level nesting for inner and outer (not in scope: n-level nesting)
 * more color swatches
 * user-defined colors for enumerations
 * ? user defined colors for continuous coloring
 * min/max-value in continuous coloring
 * improvements on legend (Tanyas idea with number badges, gray-scale printing)
 * vector format for PDF (so that magnified PDF has no visible pixels)
 * settings (filter, coloring, ...) in title and/or legend

Additional issues:
 * long names in boxes: clip only, or wider boxes, or more lines? NOT: smaller font size.
