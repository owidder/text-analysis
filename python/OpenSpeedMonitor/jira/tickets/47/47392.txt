NCD: It is impossible to change a range for first used filtering option (Filtering)	"Steps to reproduce:
1. Go to NCD page-> context menu for inner element
2. Select any filtering option by numeric properties
3. Select a range with Range slider
4. Open ontext menu for inner elements
5. Select any other filtering option by numeric properties
6. Select a range for second filtering option with Range slider
7. Click on settings line for first used filtering option
Actual: Range slider foe second used filtering option stays open
Expected: Range slider for first second used filtering option appears

Comment: If user removes second applied option - result will be the same"		Bug	iteraplan PO	06/Feb/15 12:11 PM	19/Jan/16 1:57 PM														"15/Apr/15 10:29 AM;wfr;Recommendation
ask daria if there is a workaround like:
bq. remove the first filtering item and set it again with new value
OR reproduce and try yourself

issue is likely to be linked with -326 because in both cases the range slider does not close or refresh with the new element

if no good workaround, fix it now

as for -326: if control/event flow is to complicated: defer

  "	"15/Apr/15 2:29 PM;msr;It is difficult to change the range of previous filters (first it looks like impossible, then when you click several times on the range slider, it gets possible).

Each new filter should appear with new range slider and previous range sliders should save the configuration."	16/Apr/15 3:44 PM;msr;Postponed after Release April-2015
