Problem loading some saved nesting cluster diagrams with wrong language	"_Reproduce:_
# Log into iteraplan, go to Nesting Cluster Diagram page
# Configure a diagram with outer type Information Systems, inner type IS Domains
# Set coloring of outer type to attribute based coloring, selecting ""Complexity""
# Save diagram
# Reset diagram configuration
# Change language
# Load the previously saved diagram

_Expected:_ Diagram loaded and its configuration displayed
_Actual:_ An error message popup appears. Diagram configuration is loaded, but coloring configuration of outer type is corrupted. If you execute the diagram, some rectangles are displayed in black

Saved diagram configurations should be locale-independent."		Bug	iteraplan PO	28/Oct/14 4:16 PM	30/Oct/14 3:56 PM					cluster	nesting	savedquery							30/Oct/14 3:55 PM;fam;Checked and okey.
