Fulltext search on overview page without functional permission leads to error page	"On an overview page, when a fulltext search is performed by a user, who doesn't have the following functional permission:

TypeOfFunctionalPermission.SEARCH(""role.permission.Search"")
""Run search on Building Blocks"" / ""Nutzung der Volltextsuche""

... an error page is shown.

The fulltext search field should be hidden like the global search field, when the user doesn't have this permission."
