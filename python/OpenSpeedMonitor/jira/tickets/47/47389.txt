Setting children via REST can cause data corruption	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_
# Use a REST client of your choice
# *GET* a single Infrastructure Element: ...iteraplan/api/data/InfrastructureElement/<id>
# In the resulting JSON data, add a new entry in the ""children"" relation.
{noformat}
...
  ""children"": [ <old entries, if existing>, {""id"": ""<new child id>""}],
...
{noformat}
The new entry should refer to the first Infrastructure Element which currently is on the top level of the hierarchy.
# *PUT* the changed JSON data to the URL from before.

_Expected:_ Two infrastructure elements changed, everything fine.
_Actual:_ Two infrastructure elements changed, but once you try to use the tree view in infrastructure elements, or to view the virtual root element, error pages are shown.

_Reason:_
In the virtual root element's children list is a null entry, because there is a gap in the position values in the IE table in the database.
This most likely happens because the special treatment for this case in {{RelationshipSetter#checkParent}} is not called for the new child because the REST call only considers the one ""main"" infrastructure element."
