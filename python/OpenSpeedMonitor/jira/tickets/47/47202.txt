bulk run of consistency checks fails	"Trying to run several consistency checks at once fails with the standard error:

{{A general technical error occurred. To continue, please click Close or Cancel, or clear the current session.}}

This can be reproduced when navigating to / Governance / Consistency Checks and clicking ""Run"" for the first block ""Consistency Checks - Information System Landscape"" (or some other ""Run"" button that executes several checks). Singles checks worked well so far.
