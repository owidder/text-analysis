Add to context menu submenus for the axis types	"assuming that the lsd configuration provides a list of available types for a (x or y) axis for a given content type, 

add a submenu for x (and y) axis to display these types.

submenu changes the setting in the lsd configuration.

note: selecting a type T for X axis removes (or disables) this type in the list for the Y axis, and vice versa.

the new menus are
* (1) extra context menus for the axis areas OR
* (2) an additional submenu for the existing context menu on the content area OR
* (3) both (1) and (2)
* (4) something else?

What is easier, what can be added later?
