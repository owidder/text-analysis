Extend tool area filter dialog for combined filters	"This issue is now for completing the combined filter dialog with respect to the composition of single filters.



Scope of this issue:

* Adding and removing relationship end filters, ""and"" and ""or"" combined filters.

* Update of the diagram on adding/removing filters (in some cases clicking ""apply"" may be necessary)

* Primary filter always at least contains one empty single filter



Not: ""no connection"" relationship end filter. This will be done in ITERAPLAN-4373



##############

*Old and really confusing and chaotic description. Please disregard.*



* Filter dialog should always display all configured filter

* Filters can be removed from filter dialog display (no extra listing of ""current filters"" anymore)

* All configured filters can be modified



Add a button like  ""more"" or ""advanced settings"" for related type filters in the ToolAreaDialog.

No extra submenu for related type filters anymore.



(""Simple"" view:

* Only main type properties available for filtering

* AND/OR composition possible)



""Advanced"" view:

* Related types filters are selectable, too

* Change to simple mode only possible, if no advanced filters are configured



see attached mockups (need to be updated)

Currently:

* Single filter handling by functions in $scope

* inputDropdown patched to work for preselected items (comments mark the patched parts)

* ""Unused"" functions to be deleted after completion of the issue are marked with TODO comments (may not be exhaustive)



TODO:

* Move CSS to own file(s)

* Adapt and use functionality of relationshipEnd filters also in primary type filter

* Fix add button for new relationshipEnd filters

* Move/Refactor operator definitions and assignment to attribute value types + localization of operator names

* Check value select widgets after operator selection

* SingleFilterObject \{property, actualFilter\}: ask [~sfe]

** Move attributeIsSelectedFunction here from $scope

* Clean up temporary functions ""getFiltersForRelatedBB2"" and possibly others in lsd tool area view model builder

* Necessary parameters in ""openDialog"" may change

* Fix/complete JS doc"	07/Jan/16 10:56 AM;sfe;Originally estimated: 8	15/Jan/16 5:04 PM;msr;Please commit to FilterBranch	"27/Jan/16 10:26 AM;msr;*sfe: old comment. Please see description instead.*

Proposal for new split of functionality:



*General:*

* This ticket is responsible for filterDialogTemplate and toolAreaController, i.e. the filterDialogTemplate provides combinedFilters in a correct structure to the backend

* This might include changes in combinedFilter and singleFilters



*Details:*

* Move addFilterOnRelationshipEnd to SingleFilterHolder.js (but without any parameters -> SingleFilters should know their initial values) 

* move $scope.updateSingleFilter to SingleFilterHolder.js

* see also https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/jira/browse/ITERAPLAN-3933?focusedCommentId=94506&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-94506"	"29/Jan/16 11:14 AM;ach;Todos from ITERAPLAN-4229:

* datepicker and rangeslider do not work: Create ""updateSingleFilter""-method in SingleFilterHolder, which creates borders for datepicker and rangeslider

* enum-literal-list does not work: Create ""updateSingleFilter""-method in SingleFilterHolder, which creates borders for datepicker and rangeslider



sfe: Will be done in ITERAPLAN-4340"
