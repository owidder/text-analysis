Logger doesnÂ´t log deleted subsystems	"*Summary:* When deleting a building block, the logger reports the deleted building block with name and type. However, deleted subsystems and interfaces, for example, are not reported.



*Reproduce:*

* Add following line to log4j.properties:

{{log4j.logger.de.iteratec.iteraplan.persistence.dao.GenericBaseDAO=DEBUG}}

* Delete an Information System with interfaces.

* Check the logfile or console



*Actual:*

The deleted Information System is logged with name and type.



*Expected:*

All deleted building blocks (including Sub Information Systems and Interfaces) are logged with name and type



*Implementation*

Implement and add a new hibernate event listener for the appropriate event, which just logs the desired information."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	14/Sep/15 4:41 PM	25/Sep/15 2:48 PM														"25/Sep/15 2:31 PM;sfe;The following log configuration should now show all deleted building blocks:
