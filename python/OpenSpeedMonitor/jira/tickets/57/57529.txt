Dont Show empty Columns/Rows in LSD	"Discuss (Proposal by sfe in brackets):

- Settings in Toolarea? (yes, only in Toolarea)

- Standard? Show or dont show? (don't show because it makes diagrams smaller)

- Individual settings for columns and rows? (yes, as in classic LSD)



Why?

- Large diagrams sometimes look really empty

- Large canvas needs longer to draw than small canvas -> Improvement for big data"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	18/Sep/15 12:55 PM	24/Oct/15 3:12 PM					LSD									22/Oct/15 4:54 PM;dam;for test data ask fro or dam	"24/Oct/15 3:12 PM;sfe;Seems basically fine now.
