No Notification when building block is created via REST	"_Reproduce:_

# Activate Notifications

# Subscribe to, for example, building block type Business Process

# Create a new Business Process using REST



_Expected:_ Notification E-Mail as when a Building Block is created using the GUI

_Actual:_ No Notification.



_Reason:_ Notifications are implemented using AOP, and the pointcuts to intercept building block creation use methods in FrontendServices. Those methods, however, are not used when creating new Building Blocks using REST, and most likely when using Excel Import, too."
