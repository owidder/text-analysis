Change display of "on/off" entries in tool area	"Currently, on/off entries are displayed as in following example for orphans in LSD:



* ""Show orphan items"" - means currently orphan items are not shown. Click to display them.

* ""Hide orphan items"" - means currently orphan items are shown. Click to hide them.



Click on the option changes the display to the other one.



To make it easier to grasp which the current status of the option is, change this according to following example:

* Text doesn't change anymore. Display only ""Show orphan items""

* Also display one of the following in the same menu entry:

** on/off switch symbol on the right side. Do this only if possible without much effort, meaning if possible with what our frameworks offer.

** Checkbox in front of the text"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	29/Sep/15 5:32 PM	27/Aug/16 11:34 AM														27/Aug/16 11:34 AM;fka;Done with other work on the tool area
