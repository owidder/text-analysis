"Nodes filtered by" always shown in the IFD-Legend	"*Actual:*

The entry ""Nodes filtered by"" is always shown in the IFD-Legend.



*Expected:*

The headline ""Nodes filtered by"" should only be shown if there are active filters."		Bug	iteraplan PO	02/Oct/15 3:47 PM	06/Oct/15 4:46 PM														"06/Oct/15 4:16 PM;ach;fixed: 

* method _drawFilters()_ don't need the whole _legendGroups_ configuration object. _nodeFiltering_/_edgeFiltering_ is enough

* corresponding renaming in _drawFilters()_

* leave function on empty filters earlier



(?) why do we store filters in an object (and not array)? 

* i guess (was already implemented) because filtering attribute persistent name is a primary key for _filters_ (you can not filter by _name=""a""_ and by _name=""b""_ simultaneously)"
