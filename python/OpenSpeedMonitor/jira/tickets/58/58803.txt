find a uniform date format for the toolArea (IFD and LSD)	"In the new IFD and in the LSD dates are stored in different formats.

In IFD we use milliseconds. But there could be problems with dates before 1970.

For this solution we have an individually adjustable output format.



In LSD we use a compact date format (yyyymmdd) to store a date.

But the output format is in the US format (mm/dd/yyyy).



For the ToolArea we need a unified form to save the dates.

Currently the ToolArea has switches in various places in the code to read both formats but those switches have bugs and are not optimal. 



Find a Future-proof solution and discuss this with Wolfgang and Marcel. "		Bug	iteraplan PO	01/Oct/15 10:33 AM	05/Oct/15 11:01 AM														"01/Oct/15 3:34 PM;dam;toolArea works at the moment only with milliseconds

desicion: milliseconds for date format is ok. we don´t support date before 1970"	"01/Oct/15 6:09 PM;fka;Are you sure? iteraplan Classic supports dates at least from 1900 on.

Please discuss with [~wfr]."	"02/Oct/15 8:52 AM;dam;first decision by meeting wasn´t correct.

Call with Wolfgang with new desicion:



+intern date format = ""YYYYMMDD""+



reasons for this format:

*human readability

*correct string compare

*full range of dates

*old client support dates from 1900"	"05/Oct/15 8:06 AM;dam;Filter for durations doesn´t work. I create a new ticket for this problem.

Iteraplan-3960"	"05/Oct/15 9:27 AM;fro;dataModel & ifdDataService:

replace ""replaceAll"" with ""xxx.replace(/-/g, '');""



ifdDataService:

maybe: 

remove if/else if / elseif and replace with switch case

switch (checkDataFormat(fieldValue)) {

case formatX:

case formatY:

case formatZ:

}



remove ""optionalValue"" from checkISValuesAgainstBounds and just check if filteredValue is an Array

just call checkISValuesAgainstBounds 1 time after if/else or switch"	"05/Oct/15 10:33 AM;dam;replaced ""replacedAll"" with regex ""replace(/-/g.'')""

and build switch/case"
