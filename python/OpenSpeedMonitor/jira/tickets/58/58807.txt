Create a Test Scheme for the LSD	"Based on the model of the test description files located under iteraplan/doc/test/ create a test scheme for the LSD.

This includes the following steps:

* Create a matrix of the input parameters and their possible values

* Define a matrix of the possible output parameters and their values

* Create test cases which describe the steps one has to perform to configure the creation of a LSD based on these input parameters

* Match the test cases and the input and output parameters so that every cell in the matrix appears at least once in a test"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	01/Oct/15 10:43 AM	06/Nov/15 7:23 AM
