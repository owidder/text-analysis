names of axis attributes are not always correctly displayed in the ToolArea	"In the new *LSD*: When filtering, names of axis attributes are not always correctly translated or properly displayed in the Tool Area.



*Reproduce*

* Open the LSD with the default configuration.

* open the Tool Area for the X-Axis (Based on Technical Component)

* use the Tool Area to create a new filter 



*Expected*

* in the dropdown list the entry for typeOfStatus is shown as “Status (TC)”



*Actual*

* the dropdown list show the persistent name “typeOfStatus” 



The same problem exist for the view “current Filter”.



I think that something went wrong in “lsdToolAreaViewModelBuild.js”

Take a look to the functions:

* getAllAttributes

* getMenuEntriesForFilters
