Add "feature type" and "multivalue" columns to history table	"To allow for possible future reformatting/parsing of locale-dependent values even from history, add their ""feature type"" as column. Possible data types:

* Decimal (number attributes)

* Text (text attributes or fields like ""name"")

* Richtext (multiline text attributes and for example ""description"")

* Enumeration (userdefined enum attributes)

* Responsibility (responsibility attributes)

* Date (date attributes)

* Datetime (for example last modification time)

* Duration (runtime period)

* Status (status of Information System and Technical Component)

* Direction (Direction of Interfaces and Transports/InformationFlows)

* Relationship (for all relationship assignments)



Also add as additional column information whether the feature is multi assignment or not.



To do:

* create feature type enum

* change history mapping

* adjust history entity classes

* add the feature type to SingleChange and set it in ModelChangeBuilder

* write feature type to history entities

* add feature type information to the json data returned by the history REST resource"		Improvement	iteraplan Thunderduck	07/Oct/16 2:07 PM	18/Oct/16 11:48 AM
