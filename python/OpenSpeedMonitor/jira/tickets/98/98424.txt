Create Tab view	"*Summary:*

Create a tab view, i.e.



* The tabs are shown beneath the standard attributes and before the attribute groups

* 5 Tabs (left to right): ""All"" (German: ""Alle""), ""Attributes"" (German: ""Merkmale""), ""Self-Relations"" (German: ""Selbst-Beziehungen""), ""Relations"" (German: ""Beziehungen""), History (German: ""Historie"")

* ""All""-Tab has a noticable color

* The actual selected tab is highlighted

* ""All""-Tab is the default

* If you select a tab, only this section is shown (=filtered for this section), e.g. selecting the attributes-tab only displays all attributes, no self-relations, no relations, no history

* Save the actual selected tab in the url"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	07/Oct/16 11:32 AM	02/Nov/16 11:49 AM														"17/Oct/16 1:00 PM;roia;Partially done.

TODO: save active tab in URL, handle the situation if saved tab cannot be shown (e.g., history is disabled, there're no relations, etc.)."	"20/Oct/16 11:24 AM;roia;{quote}""All""-Tab has a noticable color{quote}

-- I'm not sure that's good idea. There will be tabs with 3 different styles: ""All"" tab with ""noticable"" color, selected tab (e.g. ""Relations"") and all other tabs and this may confuse user, which tab is currently active -- ""noticable"" or really active."	"21/Oct/16 9:37 AM;msr;Maybe you find two ways to mark the tabs:

One for ""All""-Tab and one for the active tab."	"25/Oct/16 9:50 AM;roia;Surely I can find two ways to mark the tabs, I'm just saying that marking them in two ways will confuse user.

See the attached all-tab-bg-color.png: currently the active tab is marked with the different font color and red underline. I have also made a different background color for the ""ALL"" tab.

I've also attached an alternate option -- gray background and bold font for ""ALL"" tab (ALL-gray-bold.png)

We can use these styles if you'd like, but I find this confusing."	"25/Oct/16 11:45 AM;msr;Thank you for the detailed explanation.

Could you please send me another screenshot with the ""All""-Tab is only bold without any different background?"	25/Oct/16 11:50 AM;roia;[~msr], please see the attached only-bold.png	25/Oct/16 11:59 AM;msr;Please take only-bold.png	02/Nov/16 11:49 AM;madu;https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-143
