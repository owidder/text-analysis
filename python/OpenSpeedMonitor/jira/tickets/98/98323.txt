Misc. history improvements + changes	"Collcetion of small improvements and changes for the new history implementation:



# Add column with building block String identifier (e.g. name) to all history db tables and adjust the Java code accordingly

** Use getIdentityString() method which is implemented for all building blocks

** For InformationSystemInterface: adjust getIdentyString() method, so that it returns the following:

*** If name of InfromationSystemInterface not empty: identityString = name + "" "" + hierarchNameA + "" "" + getDirection() + "" "" + hierarchNameB;

*** Else: identityString = hierarchNameA + "" "" + getDirection() + "" "" + hierarchNameB;

# Make sure Date and/or DateTime values are formatted properly in the history db tables

# Change column type for ID_BB columns in all history tables from BigInteger to Integer

# Use JsonArray instead of CSVWriter to save multi-value or relationship attributes"		Improvement	iteraplan Thunderduck	06/Oct/16 11:41 AM	11/Oct/16 9:46 AM														07/Oct/16 9:30 AM;mse;Point 3 is realized in ticket IPTT-181.
