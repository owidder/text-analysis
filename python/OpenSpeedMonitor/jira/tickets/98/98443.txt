AFTER-RELEASE: Borderlines feature is not working after changing row/column association	"*Steps to reproduce:*

1) Open default LSD

2) Set Line type by enumeration property (e.g. Complexity) in the toolarea. Now cells have dashed lines on the border.

3) Change row or column association



*Current result:*

Legend still show “Line type by” option, but cells are displayed without dashed lines (see second screenshot in attachments)



*Expected result:*

Cells are displayed with dashed lines, according to their property values.



Please, ensure that borderlines feature works correct after changing row/column association. If needed - reset this feature if selected ""Line type by"" attribute is not supported for new row/column association."
