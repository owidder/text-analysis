Attribute Group Overview (Read-Only)	"*Summary:*

Create an Attribute Group Overview which is accessible from the ""Attribute Groups""-Tile.



*Details:*

* REST-API is defined in IPTS-203

* Existing AngularJS-Lib is better than building this feature ourselves



*Features:*

* Show all Attribute Groups and their included attributes

* No paging

* Move single (and multiple) attributes from one Attribute Group to another - best would be drag & drop

* Re-order single (and multiple) attributes within one Attribute Group - best would be drag & drop

* Do *not* show permissions or last modification-info

* Optional: Include Description (Info-Button) and ""Show these attributes next to the core attributes:""-information => No Detail-page needed"		New Feature	iteraplan Thunderduck	07/Oct/16 4:24 PM	28/Nov/16 9:11 AM														"02/Nov/16 4:17 PM;mwe;Discussed with [~msr]:

* Should be like a tree structure

** Attribute groups as parents

** Attributes as children 

* Drag'n'drop sorting/moving:

** Move position of attribute in list of attributes in attribute group

** Move position of attribute group in list of attribute gorups

** Move attribute from one attribute group to another attribute group"	09/Nov/16 12:55 PM;mwe;Because this issue is for the read-only functions of attribute groups the drag'n'drop functionality does not change anything in the data.	"25/Nov/16 12:54 PM;mse;Review comments:



* The ""open details"" button jumps from top to the very right when the details are opened -> Maybe better if it stays next to the attribute group name

* The Top level attribute group can be dropped into one of the other group as a normal attribute"
