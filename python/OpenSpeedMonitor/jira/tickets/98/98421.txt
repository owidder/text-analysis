MONDAY: Show History	"*Summary:*

Show the new history at the bottom of the single element view in the tabs ""All"" and in the tab ""History""



*REST resource:* https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/jira/browse/IPTT-121



*Process:*

1. Check, if history is active by asking global angular service ""historyActiveService"" (at the moment developed by [~pma] ) 

2. Only if history is active, send a GET-request to get details of the history while opening the Single Element View 

2. Prepare JSON-data from this REST-interface

3. Display the whole history at the bottom of the tab: ""All"" and in the tab ""History""



*Implementation details:*

* Show the whole history (no paging)

* No translation

* If history is disabled, do not show the tab ""History"" at all

* Use the order you get from REST"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	07/Oct/16 11:31 AM	24/Oct/16 1:52 PM														"17/Oct/16 1:15 PM;msr;UI:

 they already contain the ""type"" of the substantial-type at the end of the relation

 they already have ""BusinessProcess"" as type and not the relation ""BusinessMapping"" in between

 do not show the business mapping, but the end points like business process, business unit, product or information system"	"18/Oct/16 9:55 AM;roia;{quote}""old"" and ""new"" for single-valued-attribues""{quote}



I'd use something like [oldValue] ==> [newValue], which could fit better in one line and, IMO, is more convenient to read, but currently implemented as required with ""old"" and ""new"" words."	"18/Oct/16 10:00 AM;msr;*How to show attribute-changes on relations?*

In the ""Changes"" column: NAME OF RELATION : NAME OF RELATED ELEMENT : _already implemented handling of attributes_ "	"18/Oct/16 10:02 AM;msr;*How to display changes in relations?* (added or deleted relations):
