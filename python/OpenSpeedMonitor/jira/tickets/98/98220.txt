Fix history change type mapping and runtime period "non-changes"	"When the history for an element is written,

* the change type is written to the database as ""raw data"", most likely binary serialization of the java enum object

* and if the element has a ""unbounded"" runtime period (meaning both start and end dates are undefined), a change of runtime period from ""null"" to the unbounded period is written.



To do:

* the change type should be written to the database as human readable string

* runtime period ""non-changes"" should not be written to the database"		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	05/Oct/16 12:24 PM	11/Oct/16 9:57 AM
