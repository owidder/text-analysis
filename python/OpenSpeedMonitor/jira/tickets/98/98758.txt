I checked the test sheet and one point is missing:



- When you have more than one attribute, you can mark e.g. elements and with drag and drop change the position 



For the ""Params and Outputs"" you can youse for ""iteraplan logo"" - ""Close and Open"" :-) 

The User Profile is a new feature in Version 5.4 and saves the last stand in the diagrams and lists. 



Greetings,
