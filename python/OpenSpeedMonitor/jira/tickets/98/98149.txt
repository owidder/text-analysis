Question on LDAP authentication	"We have LDAP authentication and sometimes SSL is very slow. Microsoft is asking us to see the code which creates this issue. 



Can you deliver the 5-10 lines of code you use to query ldap server and authenticate the user ?

thank you for your inquiry.

We using for the LDAP authentication ""Spring Security"" Version 3.2.2. 
http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-3.2.xsd

You could check the settings, in the file ""applicationContext-spring-security.xml"" on the path ""$TOMCAT\iteraplan instance\WEB-INF"".
