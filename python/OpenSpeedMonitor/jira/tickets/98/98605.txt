String Identifier in Business Mapping History	"Reproduce: Delete a business mapping via one of its connected building blocks.



Problem: The building block is disconnected before the delete for the business mapping is performed. Therefore, the pointer to this builing block in the business mapping entity is null. The string identifier which is stored in the history database table for the business mapping is then for example:



{{null / Management : Performance Monitoring : Quality / Funct. Departments : Finance / -}}



Improvement: it would be better if the original identifier for the business mapping would be stored, like:



{{BI # 1.0 / Management : Performance Monitoring : Quality / Funct. Departments : Finance / -}}



Possible solutions:

* Either try to avoid the disconnect before the business mapping is deleted -> Not sure, if this is really possible or not too complicated

* Re-build the identifier from the information in the ModelChange event in case it contains ""null"" -> not very elegant, but probably not too difficult. Not sure if it will always work though..."
