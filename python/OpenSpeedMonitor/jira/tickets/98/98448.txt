Stephan provided a mapping for the classic-Java-types to the Elastic-types. Please include this in the REST-interface



*Classic -> Elastic*

Number -> Decimal (normal numeric properties)

Number -> Integer (System numeric properties: Id and position)

Single text line -> text

Mulit-line text -> richtext"	"07/Nov/16 6:18 PM;ants;Permission handling is not implemented for the resource.

Steps to reproduce:

1. Log in as user with no permissions for ""Configure attribute groups""

2. In classic client there is no menu entry for Administration --> Attribute groups and user gets ""No permissions"" error via URL copying.

3. But REST resource /api/atg is available without any error.
