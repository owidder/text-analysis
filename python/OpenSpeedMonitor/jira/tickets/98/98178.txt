Export / Import	"Hi,



I try to test in release 5.3 the IMPORT problem fixed in 5.2 and and I get  another one. The test is as simple as downloading all the data contained in our database and trying to upload it without making any change. I get the message :""The value """" of property ""Date classification"" of the object of type ""Information System"" with id 18,069 is invalid and will be ignored"" for each line.



Thanks



Claude Lamy

thank you for your inquiry.

When you import the same export in iteraplan without any changes, the software ignores the existing entrys.

Would you please explain the bug you describe in the ticket?

I simply  downloaded data with filter « Information Systems » in an Excel file and uploaded back the same file the minute after without modifing it.

thank you for your reply.

I checked the problem and here is the work a round for this behavior.

The reason for the warning is the column type ""General"" in Excel.
Would you please change the column type into ""date"", afterwards the warnings disappear on the import.

I created a improvement ticket for this issues and it will be fixed in the upcoming versions.

I still get the same messages even if i change the cells format to « date ».

I first need the security department approval ...

Thanks,

It's a bit complicated to send you an ""anonymous"" data file. Could you please tell me what could be your solution ?

BEst regards.

I checked the work a round again and you can use the following steps to stop the warnings:

# Change the column types in ""Date"", in every empty field where the warning appeared
# Enter a fake Date, copy these in every changed field from step 1 (this is necessary!)
# When this done, delete all dates which you copied in step 2

This will be stop the warnings on the import because the fields have now  the correctly format.
You can check this work a round on one empty field from the export.
