Building Blocks with more than 1 enumeration value are not shown in the Landscape Diagram	"*Summary:*

Building Blocks with more than 1 enumeration value are not shown in the Landscape Diagram, when you choose this enumeration attribute as axis element.



*Reproduce:*

* Create an enumeration attribute, which allows multi-values

* Assign a Building Block 2 enumeration attribute values

* Create a new Landscape Diagram with this Building Block Type as Content Type and the enumeration type as axis type.



Actual result: The Building Block is not shown.

Expected result: The Building Block should be shown twice (one in column of value 1, one in column of value 2)."
