View for Toolarea Directive	"*Summary:*

Create a DropDown/Menu Directive. This directive displays a menu structure of items. The menu can have nested submenus. The menu items are provided by the ToolAreaViewModelBuilder.



*Architecture:*

This directive inherits from the ToolAreaDirective (by ""require"").

The template works with a generic structure of menu items (with the help of ""ng-repeat"" and ""ng-style"").

Some menu css properties have to be manipulated by javascript (nested submenus).



*Interaction:*

This directive deals with onClick-events on its menu items. The functions for these events are provided by ToolAreaViewModelBuilder. On click: this directive hands over an event (incl. function) to the ToolAreaController.
