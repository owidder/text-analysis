Toolarea Directive	"*Summary:*

Create a ToolareaDirective as a directive for the commonHeader template. This directive builds a toolArea based on the toolarea items of the ToolAreaViewModelBuilder. It controls the subdirective for the menu ( ITERAPLAN-3811 ).



*Architecture:*

This directive inherits from the common Header directive (by ""require""). This directive initiats the ToolAreaViewModelBuilder.

This directive builds up the toolArea dynamically (with ""ng-repeat"")."	47838	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	20/Jul/15 10:45 AM	09/Sep/15 2:21 PM					ifd									"04/Aug/15 9:23 AM;msr;Open TODOs:
