MM-Translation with translate provider	"When a Metamodel-GET is performed, add the localized names of all metamodel elements to the translate provider, for the current locale.

Use the persistent name as key."	49816	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	20/Jul/15 9:48 AM	04/Aug/15 9:27 AM														"31/Jul/15 7:05 PM;sfe;Works:

Static text localizations and metamodel localizations are loaded into translate provider. Format of metamodel localizations as in following example:

{noformat}

for en:

...

staticTextKey1: ""static text value 1"", 

...

metamodel: {

  ArchitecturalDomain: {

    name: 'Architectural Domain',

    pluralName: 'Architectural Domains',

    'State of Health': {

      name: 'State of Health',

      pluralName: 'State of Health'

    }

    ...

  }

  ...

}

{noformat}



Needs to be done:

* NCD doesn't seem to work. Possibly because of changed metamodel data, since, for example, ""name"" is now not a simple string, but an object with fields ""en"" and ""de"".

* Translation refresh when new metamodel is loaded. See also $translate.refresh(locale). Maybe not necessary in this ticket.

* Maybe part of ITERAPLAN-3750?: Check whether keys with dots work properly. Since persistent names are used as keys in metamodel localization, the localization data of, for example, the enumeration type ""State of Health"" can look as follows:

{noformat}

metamodel: {

  ...

  ""de.iteratec.iteraplan.model.attribute.EnumAT.State of Health"": {

    name: ""State of Health"",

    ...

    good: {

      name: ""good"",

      ...

    },

    ...

  }

  ...

}

{noformat}"	"03/Aug/15 4:53 PM;ach;* using of new _REST_-service breaks _new client_. Need to complete *ITERAPLAN-3750* before using _icmm_ and _icd_ (no hot fix possible) 

* using dots in translation keys make no problems 

* _$translate.refresh_ not needed as long we have no partial update of metamodel changes"
