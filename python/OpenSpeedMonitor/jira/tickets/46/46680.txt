Column order in tabular report is not saved for a saved query	"If a new tabular report is created and new columns are added, the column ordering will be discarded after the saved query is loaded again.

To reproduce this issue:

1. Goto Tabular Report (e.g. for information systems) and execute a query
2. Add some columns to it (eg. Costs, Complexity)
3. Reorder the columns
4. Save the query
5. Load the query again

Now the column order is different as it was before loading the query again. But the column order must be saved for a saved query. "		Improvement	iteraplan PO	12/Jun/14 1:45 PM	19/Jan/16 11:08 AM
