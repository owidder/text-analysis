(Cluster) diagram with empty element set leads to error page	"Scenario:
* A (Cluster) diagram configuration is saved with a certain result set, like for example:
_InformationSystems that start with ""A""_.
* The link to this diagram is provided to other people, who bookmark this link.
* In the meantime, all InformationSystems starting with ""A"" are deleted.
* When the diagram link is used, it will lead to an error page (clicking on ""Execute"" in the diagram overview has the same result).

Clarify (and implement) the expected behavior:
* Show an empty diagram?
* Show a message (page?) like ""diagram cannot be generated, because the element set is empty""?

Idea: ""No building blocks to display.""
As far as I know, the user documentation calls them ""building blocks"".

Capitalisation:
The diagram
Das Diagramm
Both are sentence fragments with a full stop, so they start with a capital letter.

 "	"14/Jul/14 11:37 AM;isc;Solution is, we show an empty diagram with a information, that no building blocks available to display.
This solution was implemented only for the cluster diagrams. For all other diagram types, a follow ticket is created."	15/Jul/14 3:00 PM;dop;Text in graphic is not shown for filetype PDF.	16/Jul/14 8:50 AM;isc;I have changed the generation, so now PDF is displays correctly.
