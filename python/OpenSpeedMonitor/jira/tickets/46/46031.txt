# Export the model as Excel File 
# Import the Excel file. 
# Assuming you have the bank data loaded, you should safely progress to the step where metamodel changes have been applied.

*Effect:*

* The dry-run step where changes are applied to the model fails with a technical error message.
* internally, the following null pointer exception occurred: {code}

"		Bug	iteraplan PO	28/Aug/13 9:33 AM	05/Sep/13 4:56 PM					excel	import	permissions							"28/Aug/13 6:37 PM;sry;Suggested workaround: Grant more extensive permissions to the (technical) user that initiates the import process.

The exception seems to be thrown in permission-sensitive part of the Elastic implementation in 3.1, which is problematic in general. I suppose this would require a larger rework of that code. We will need more time to get this right.

For the time being, I would strongly suggest to use the proposed workaround."	05/Sep/13 4:56 PM;sry;Works. Please merge the additional change to the branch as well.	06/Sep/13 11:12 AM;psc;Reviewed. Implementation fixes the issue. Ticket will be closed.
