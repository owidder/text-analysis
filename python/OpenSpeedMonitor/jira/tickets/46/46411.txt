Enhance Usability of ExcelModelMapper	"Write the Excel workbook in a look and feel as in 3.2, that is:
* same visual design (including visible/hidden elements)
* same behavior (drop down, formatting of edited or entered values, click on links).

Obviously, the tester will export workbooks with 3.2 and the current version and compare them side by side, sheet by sheet.

In more detail:

Before the XlsModelMapper (ITERAPLAN-2160) can be used in production, the following issues should be addressed:
* Format rows as in current production mode
* Decide about inclusion of TimeSeries Sheets and implement if required
* Format RelationshipEnd-Columns to provide Dropdown-Lists
* Format Cells according to their DataType
* Implement XlsTitlePageWriter.write() to produce title page similar to 3.2 release
* Implement a consistent Date-Handling approach (Date, vs. Datetime, DateIntervals)"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	14/Jan/14 4:26 PM	03/Mar/14 4:11 PM					excel	export	import	localization	mapping	usability				14/Jan/14 4:28 PM;mba;Consistent date handling in Excel should not be implemented before the new AtomicDataType for DateTime has been implemented	"21/Jan/14 9:23 AM;isc;A few more things are still open from the previous ticket, which should be implemented in this ticket.
* (/) The XlsModelMapper use only the HSSFWorkbook which create only xls documents. Still open are xlsx documents, which can be created with XSSFWorkbook. 
* Furthermore, there are still some open TODOs in the code among other things also in error handling.
* Furthermore,  should be test if elasticEAM is supported.

""The sequence of columns is as follows: id, name (if present), description (if present), all remaining columns alphabetically ordered according to the localised name""

TimeSeries Sheets not be included
In the TitlePage we need the iteraplan version, therefor I extend the XlsModelMapper by a parameter. 
"	"07/Feb/14 8:53 AM;isc;Support of elasticEAM could not be finally testet. Because:
* The TitlePage contains for elasticMi additonal cell, which are in elasticEAM missing. This additional cell are importend for the partial export. 
* The old excel format (3.2) could be readed, but I have got some errors when I try to import the model.
* I could not import new OE, because for new OS is an ID is required."	07/Feb/14 10:03 AM;mba;Issue with failing Import of new OEs (where ID column is empty) has been resolved;	"10/Feb/14 6:41 AM;isc;improvement idea:
The date format could be saved in the iteraplan properties. Thus we would be more flexible with the date format."	"10/Feb/14 4:16 PM;sfe;In case of a partial export, please do not add references to the (hidden) reference type sheets to the introduction sheet.
Aside from that I did not properly test this issue so far."	10/Feb/14 5:09 PM;isc;hidden sheets aren't anymore referenced	"27/Feb/14 11:37 AM;gph;Looks good and as in 3.2:
* Sheets
* Styles
* Dropdowns
* Hidden cells

Found some small issues:
* (/) Type overview on introduction sheet & sheet names don't have the trailing abbreviated name, like in 3.2 => fixed by isc
* (/) On introduction sheet: Two empty lines between the sections instead of one in 3.2 => fixed by isc
* (x) Type names on the introduction sheet & the type sheets are not ordered like in 3.2, where the types were ordered in the same way as in the EA-Data menu. 
According to *wfr*: Fix this issue in the Metamodel-Bridge. The ordering of the structured types must be the same as in the menu (like in 3.2). When the type groups AND the types inside the type groups are ordered correctly in the metamodel in the right way, then the Excel mapper should simply output these types in this order.
* (/) Different cell formats for LM(T): 3.2->Date; trunk->custom   according to isc, this is ok
* (/) Description-column took nearly the whole screen width  => fixed by isc
* (x) (Still) varying capitalizations in table headers
*wfr*: All column headers in english localization should be capitalized (in Excel Mapper), because they are [""title case""|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Letter_case#Headings_and_publication_titles].
In german capitalization, the headers' case should not be formatted.
(x) The order of the columns inside a sheet is not deterministic. *wfr*: The order should be: Id,Name,Description, and then the remaining columns in alphabetical order.
* (/) Fully qualified class names at $TypeOfStatus- & Direction-Enums on introduction sheet  => fixed by isc
"	"03/Mar/14 10:52 AM;isc;* (/) Type names on the introduction sheet & the type sheets are now ordered like in 3.2. In agreement with Wolfgang, I have implemented a small hack.
* (/) All column headers in english localization are be capitalized
* (/) The order of the columns inside a sheet is now deterministic
