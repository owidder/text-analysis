Analyse: Possible Improvements regarding import speed with large models	"As-is: importing data from an Excel takes longer than in the previous iteraplan release 3.2.

* analyse where the time consuming steps are, and how many of them are done depending of the size of the a) existing data (left hand side model) and the imported data (right hand side model). Sketch a simple formula to estimate the number of these steps.

* sketch at least 3 ways to improve the match/diff/merge... process so that there are less of the steps above. How does each measure improve the computation to save steps? How many, approximately?

* estimate the complexity and the effort for each measure. Propose one. 

In this ticket: enhance the code so that it counts the critical/time consuming steps. Log the aggregated counts, Do not log the steps one by one and aggregate over the log text.

Not in this ticket: Implement the measures. This comes later. This ticket is only the analysis.

Write the results in a wiki page, for it will be to much for ticket comments.

Split this ticket in subtasks as appropriate."
