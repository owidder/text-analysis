Missing messages when deleting Business Mappings	"When removing an Information System from a Business Mapping, in step 5 I get the message that 1 Business Mapping is deleted and 1 Information System is changed.
But Business Process, Business Unit and Product have been also changed. This information is still missing.

*Reproduce:*

# Navigate to iteraplan -> Mass Data -> Export/Import
# Download Excel data
# Edit Excel file: remove the Information System in one row of the Business Mapping sheet
# Import with overwrite (CUD) strategy

After step 5, I would also expect a message that Business Process, Business Unit and Product have been changed.

The problem is not only limited to Information Systems that can be reproduced also with the other elements in a business mapping.
"		Bug	iteraplan PO	08/Apr/14 10:28 AM	14/Jan/15 1:53 PM					excel	import								17/Dec/14 3:42 PM;sfe;This should not be an issue anymore. Please check.	17/Dec/14 4:15 PM;isc;Works only for IS, If you delete a BP or BU the issue still exists.	"18/Dec/14 11:00 AM;sfe;Can you please provide a detailed reproducer for the issue?
Removing a BP or a BU from a business mapping should generally *not* invalidate the business mapping and thus not delete it. This means only one change for the business mapping, and one change for the BP or BU should be displayed.
Exception: If after the change only the IS would be left-over in the business mapping, it becomes invalid."	"23/Dec/14 9:28 AM;isc;When you removing an Information System from a Business Mapping (with relations to BP, BU, IS) the Business Mapping will be deleted.
