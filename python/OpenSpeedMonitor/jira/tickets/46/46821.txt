The minus-sign is not treated correctly in the search fields	"The minus-sign in the search field is treated wrong.

It is neither treated as a normal character nor as as ""not""-operator.
It cannot be escaped with ""\"" either.

E.g.
We have two InformationSystems:
ARCHIV-VERW
OPT-ARCHIV

Searching:
ARCHIV => ARCHIV-VERW and OPT-ARCHIV => ok
ARCHIV -VERW => OPT-ARCHIV => ok
ARCHIV-VERW => no result => fault
ARCHIV\\-VERW => no result => fault
""ARCHIV-VERW"" => ARCHIV-VERW => ok

Escaping the minus with backslash does not yield the expected results (version 3.3.2).
 You have to use quotes to find systems with a minus-sign in the name.
 E.g.:
 Account-Sys -> no result
 Account-Sys -> no result
 ""Account-Sys"" -> result: Account-Sys

Actually the leading quote is enough. You don't need to close it.

In my view it is a bug that you
 a) cannot escape the minus sign
 b) a minus-sign not preceded by a blank is treated as a ""not""

As well as the message that is shown when you type in a ""-"" in the search box (regarding special characters that cannot be searched). This message is inconsistent to the comment from Sabine Buckl.

Feel free to provide me with further information in which cases the search function does not work properly, so that I can use your experience to improve the search functionality and to build testcases for it. 	22/Aug/14 8:19 AM;dop;@Reviewer: Please test the search function using different search terms. You have to add the specific building blocks first.
