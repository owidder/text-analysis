Problem reports for runtime errors	"When a runtime error occurs in iteraplan, all technical information concerning the error context is available. There should be an option to download (and/or show) this information for administrators and developers.

These problem reports can contain details about:
* stacktrace
* iteraplan properties
* environment properties
* java system properties
* active loggers/appenders
* servlet container details
* database/connection/JDBC details
* free/total memory
* permissions
* UserContext, GuiContext, localization
* HTTP-Request

Everyone should be able to create a mail that contains the download link for the zipped report (via REST?) on the error page. The download link should be restricted to administrators. Admin mail should be configurable during installation (adjust installer).

You must be able to switch this feature off by a property.

Reports are kept in memory. Make sure, that it doesn't allocate to many resources.

In future bug reports, this report can be attached instead of manually specifying environment information.

Problem reports are:
*Transparent*: The administrator has full insight to the report contents, because it is just a ZIP containing text files.
*Confidential*: Only administrators are allowed to view the collected information. Nothing will be sent automatically.
*Voluntary*: The feature can be switched off.
*Helpful*: All information need for the analysis of the problem are gathered at one place.
*Quick*: No need for time-consuming commuinication between contact person, technical administrators and support."
