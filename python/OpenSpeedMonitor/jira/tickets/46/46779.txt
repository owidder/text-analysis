Structured filter by status/complexity	"Add a structured filter to the list of information systems for the property Status"".

When the user clicks the column title ""Status"", the system displays a menu of actions, including ""only current"", ""only planned"", only inactive"", ""only target"".
In the same way, if the user clicks ""Complexity"", the actions in the menu are ""only high"" and so on.

Note that in the scope of this ticket, only these two columns must work. Name and Description columns do not have the same functions.

When the user selects on of these actions, the list will only show items that match this filter. Others disappear with a small transition.

This filter must work in combination with the text search.

When the filter is selected, a box/button/badge is displayed to the right of the title ""7 of 9 Information Systems"".
The badge has the text of the form ""Status: current"". 
The badge has a small ""remove"" icon on the right hand side.

When the user clicks the remove icon, the filter is removed, and the rows appear again (with transition).
