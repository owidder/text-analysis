Logical iteraQl operators in partial export are converted from infix notation to non-parsable prefix notation	"When an iteraQl with a logical operator (""and"", ""or"", ""not"") is exported by partial export, the notation is converted (serialized) from infix notation
{{@Attr1 = """" & @Attr2 = """"}}

to prefix notation
{{AND(@Attr1 = """", @Attr2 = """")}}

This prefix notation cannot be parsed at import time, which leads to an error:
{code}
The entered query is not syntactically correct: no viable alternative at input 'AND'
{code}

The serialization is performed in method:
{{de.iteratec.iteraplan.elasticmi.dynamic.FilterPredicate.NodePredicate.serialize(boolean)}}

A possible fix would be to change the serialization in a way, which returns parseable iteraQl in infix notation.

Write a (roundtrip-) test for this case."		Bug	iteraplan PO	24/Sep/14 10:02 AM	03/Oct/14 11:22 AM					export	import	iteraQL	partial	predicate
