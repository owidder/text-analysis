Share and save the diagram	"Add a global action button in the menu bar ""Save/Share"".

When the user clicks the action, the system displays a dialog.
The dialog has
* a prompt line ""Enter a descriptive name""
* a text input field with placeholder ""Name""
* Note: _no_ label
* A list of users with
** an avatar picture
** a user name 
* Button ""Save""
* Button ""Cancel""

The list shows 7 entries, and has about 10 entries.
The data for the user list and the avatar pictures are mocked.
The user can select elements in this list, and deselect them.
In the scope of this ticket, the selected users are ignored.

The system stores the current diagram configuration and the name the client session, that is in a JS service. It is not in the scope of this ticket to store it in HTML5 local browser storage.

The system changes the title of the diagram to the new given name.

The system adds a tile to the recent list in the home screen.
The tile has 
* an icon for ""Nesting Cluster Diagram"" (to be designed)
* icon color and background color on hover is color of IS, red
* text is the name that the user has entered in the dialog.

This new tile must work. If the user clicks it, it brings him back to the diagram in the same configuration as before. 

The actual data that the diagram shows may have changed. For example, if the complexity of an IS changes from low to high, and the diagram is colored by complexity, the box has a different color."
