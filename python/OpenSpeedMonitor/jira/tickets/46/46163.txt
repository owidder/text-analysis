REST test EE/Win7/IE9/Oracle	Testing of REST API.	46148	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	18/Oct/13 10:12 AM	22/Oct/13 6:38 PM													iteraplan EE / Win7 / IE9 / oracle / english	"18/Oct/13 3:06 PM;sfe;* Issue with requesting a specific format using header field -> ITERAPLAN-2034
* Requesting building block resource for an ID which doesn't exist returns a json file for the requested query with empty result, instead of response 404, as defined in test spec
* Some response codes are different than mentioned in test spec: 400 instead of 404, 404 instead of 401 etc. maybe test spec error?
* Permissions not always respected by REST API, see test result test case 8:
** Data resource of building block type for which no read permission exists can be requested
** Import by posting to /api/data is possible without import permission"	"22/Oct/13 7:52 AM;sfe;* Retested after clarification in ITERAPLAN-2034:
Requesting specific format using Accept header is working as specified in the test sheet.
* Also retested permissions, as changes in permissions may take some time and some arbitrary update to the iteraplan data before they are applied to the elastic resources => Data resource of building block type without read permission correctly cannot be requested

Remaining issues (see also attached REST_oracle_v2.xlsx):
* Some response codes different than in test spec
* Requesting building block resource for an ID which doesn't exist (in test ID 0) returns a json file for the requested query with empty result instead of response 404 as defined in test spec.
* Import permission still not respected by import via REST. This may be intentional? => Clarification please

Known issues:
* Incomplete metamodel localization"	22/Oct/13 6:38 PM;kgo;Seems fine so far. Some of the not OKs are still in discussion.	"24/Oct/13 10:18 AM;psc;Update regarding open issues:

1) Some response codes different than in test spec

Since access is correctly granted / denied and only the response code differs, this is a minor issue and will not be fixed before 3.2. However, it will be tracked with Ticket ITERAPLAN-2072.

2) Requesting building block resource for an ID which doesn't exist (in test ID 0) returns a json file for the requested query with empty result instead of response 404 as defined in test spec.

--> Corrected in ITERAPLAN-2045

3) Import permission still not respected by import via REST. This may be intentional? => Clarification please

--> BBT-specific permissions should be respected, no matter if you access via REST, iteraQL Console, GUI or Excel Import/Export. This is verified for REST in Ticket ITERAPLAN-2070. The functional permissions for REST and excel-import/export are ""keys"" to different interfaces, however - if the presumption is correct - neither of them implicitly grants ""admin rights"". Therefore, in accordance with Demand-Management, it is correct behavior that import/export of excel-formated information can be accessed via REST without the functional ""import/export-permission"", since this permission actually guards the GUI-interface to excel-import/export and not the formated content.

Since all complained points have been addressed in dedicated tickets, this test-execution can be closed."
