Language of information regarding filter configuration of a nesting cluster diagram is not reset after switch between languages	"Example:
* Create new Nesting Cluster configuration
* Add outer element ""information systems""
* Add inner element ""technical components""
* When language is currently set to german, both boxes contain an information like ""All elements"".
* Changing the language at that point does not lead to an update of this information. Even if the page is left and revisted later on."		Bug	iteraplan PO	08/Oct/13 4:48 PM	28/Aug/14 4:02 PM
