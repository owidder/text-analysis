Opening saved Spreadsheet Report Queries can lead to unintentionally enabled field combinations	"Apparently there can be saved queries that where - before the query is reopened - certain constellations lead to disabled fields but - after the query is reopened - the respective fields are shown in enabled state.

For example:
* Query for informationsystems whose names have arbitrary value
* Save the query
* Reopen the query
* The field for selecting a name value is now enabled

When opening saved queries field constellations should initially be checked regarding mandatory field disablement."		Bug	iteraplan PO	30/Aug/13 4:49 PM	30/Dec/15 3:17 PM
