Users have to have 'delete' permission on IS to change relationships	"I gave users create/modify but not delete permission on IS, and they were unable to add or remove relationships to the IS. When I added delete permissions, they were able to update the IS.

Modify permission should include modifying relationships (interfaces, etc.).

As a workaround I am giving all users delete permission, but that does not follow our governance model."

"15/Jul/14 9:24 AM;sfe;Business Mappings have their own permission which determines whether they can be created or deleted, even from the edit mask of, for example an Information System. This is intended.
Aside from that I was able to add or remove relations."	15/Jul/14 9:24 AM;sfe;Probably fixed within the scope of another issue.
