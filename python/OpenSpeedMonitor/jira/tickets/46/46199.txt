Importing an exported XMI Zip without modifications shows changes	"To reproduce:
* Download XMI Zip (Xmi+Ecore)
* Import the Zip without modifying anything
=> Changes in step 4

The ""changes"" concern elements with null attribute values of assigned attributes types. The EPackageConverter doesn't handle the placeholder literal for ""not assigned""-attributes correctly (this had already been fixed in iteraplan 4).

Fix this issue for 3.x. Write a test for the export-import roundtrip without modifications to make sure that no changes are detected."		Bug	iteraplan PO	23/Oct/13 10:46 AM	24/Oct/13 1:47 PM					ecore	emf	export	import	xmi					"23/Oct/13 2:51 PM;sfe;To add some details to gph's time estimation:
* The fix itself can be done by adding 2-3 lines of code in two classes: {{EPackageConverter.ImportRun#convertEnum}} and {{EPackageConverter.ExportRun#convertEnum}}.
** ExportRun: add a ""null literal"" as first literal of the EEnum, see {{EMFMetamodel#addNullLiteral}}
** ImportRun: ignore ""null literals"" (identified by name, see {{EMFEnumerationLiteral#NOT_SPECIFIED}}
** Value assignment works correctly because elements without assignment get the first literal in the list, which in this case is the ""null literal"", which even in the current elastic implementation is already treated correctly.
* The changes are highly local as the EPackageConverter is basically only used for XMI Import and Export (and tests) and the changes there can only affect enumeration attributes.
* The risk of unintended side effects is further reduced by the fact that the same fix was already implemented for the discontinued iteraplan 4 and never caused problems."	24/Oct/13 1:47 PM;bra;works, code looks plausible	"25/Oct/13 6:56 PM;psc;Reviewed. I was able to reproduce the issue in 3.1. In current trunk of 3.2 the issue no longer occurs. 

Ticket will be closed."
