Import is missing uniqueness check for relationship types	"Example with iteraplan sample data:
# Excel-Export data
# Add to the Icr2IeAssociation sheet a relation between TC ""BS2000"" and IE ""IBM Host 1""
# Add the same line a second time
# Save and import this file
=> Import progresses without errors past step 4, because we don't have a check for uniqueness of relationship type instances. In step 5 however we get an error page due to a database constraint violation.

Solution: Add an according check to the ModelValidator or IteraplanModelValidator, whichever is more fitting, so this uniqueness violation is caught before the 5th step of the import."
