Category page list search	"Search should work only for active (displayed) columns. All other data (in hidden columns) should be ignored.

The text search field right of the ""Edit columns"" must hide all rows that do not match.
An element (row) matches, if either the name, the description text or a value in another column contains the value of the search text.
Leading or trailing whitespace of the search text is ignored.
Case is ignored.
The elements filtered out should disappear with a (preliminary) animation, implemented with ng-animate and a CSS transition.
The number part must change into the form ""15 of 49 Information Systems"".
When a search text is active, there should be a (preliminary) icon right of the search text box, for example a ""X"" or similar, that clears the search text and restores the full list.
Note that this view is structurally identical for all types of elements (Technical Components, Projects, Business Processes, ...), but in the scope of this ticket only Information Systems are required.
Note that in addition to filtering by simple text matching there are ""structured filters"" of the form ""status = current"", but this is in another ticket."
