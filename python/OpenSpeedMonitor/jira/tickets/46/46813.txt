Tabular reports defect in one special case	"When trying to find InfrastructureElements that have no TechnicalComponent assigned, the following iteraQL query works and shows correct results:
InfrastructureElement[count(/technicalComponentReleaseAssociations)=0];

Check and fix the tabular report for this case."
