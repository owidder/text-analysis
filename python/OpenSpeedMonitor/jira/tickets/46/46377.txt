Infrastructure, basics and docs to run Selenium tests with multiple browsers on remote VMs	"
As a Tester you want to run the Webtests against different remote machines. The tests are executed on your local machine, but they run on the remote machines. The remote servers are our Windows XP Server (192.168.2.247) and our MS-SQL server (sql-iteraplan).

The first thing to do, is to start a selenium-hub on your local machine, later it will distribute the tests to the different nodes.

After that start the remote nodes:

If you establish a remote-desktop-connection, you will find a Selenium2Test Folder on the desktop. In this folder are the launching scripts seleniumNode.bat and the configuration File webconfig.txt. The webconfig.txt file needs to be adjusted - the line  ""hubHost"":""lt214.iteratec.de""  has to be replaced with ""hubHost"":""<your-pc>.iteratec.de"". After adjusting the line save the file and launch the seleniumNode.bat script.

The last thing to do, before launching the test, is to edit the run parameter: the test should run against internet explorer-7,internet explorer-10 and firefox.
How everything wokrs should be explained in the wiki, and the other sources.
