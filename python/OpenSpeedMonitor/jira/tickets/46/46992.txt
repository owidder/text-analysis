Switch grouping of IS from ISD to BO and back	"To the existing nesting cluster diagram, switch the element type (category) from information system domain to business object and back.

0) initially, the system shows a nesting cluster diagram with IS as inner boxes and ISD as outer (grouping) boxes.
1) the clicks an outer box
2) the system shows a context menu with ""Group by business objects"" (among other menu items)
3) the user selects the menu item
4) the system shows a new NCD with BO as outer boxes.
...
5) the user can switch back to the original grouping.

Note that:
* the connection between BO and IS is via an intermediate element type ""isr2bo"" meaning ""information system (release) to business object"".
These elements have attributes, but we do not care about them in this story.
* the NCD may have coloring settings for the inner boxes. This coloring must be applied to the new NCD with BO.

The existing implementation of a different combination ""business objects grouped by business domain"" should be preserved, not thrown away.
Make it available by an extra (new) entry in the same context menu, below the ""Group by..."" items.
Entry text: ""Business objects by business domain""
