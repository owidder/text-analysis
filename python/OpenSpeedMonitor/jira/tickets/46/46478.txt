Adapt file download behavior for all cases using Spring Webflow mechanisms	"The download button for ""Excel 2007 full model"" has been adjusted to work like this:

- Spring WebFlow (SWF) ist in starting view state.
- A ""request-Download"" event is triggered by the button click.
- The event makes a transition to an action state ""check-Download"".
- When the check ist successful, a flash attribute is stored in the POST-REDIRECT-GET chain, which will at the end trigger the download (event). A INFO-message will be shown like ""download will start automatically"".
- When the check is not successful, only the error messages are stored and displayed in the end.
- Both outcomes are followed by a transition back to the starting view state. This will cause a redirect (=refresh) in the browser.
- When the check has been successful and the flash attribute is present, then a download event ""download..."" will be triggered, when the last request-chain has finished (=page has reloaded).
- The download event calls a Action method, which performs the file download an notifies SWF to suppress the usual redirect. This will prevent IllegalStateExceptions.


All the other file downloads should have the same behavior."
