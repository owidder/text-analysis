Accessing custom dashboard instances can lead to error page	"to reproduce:
# Create a custom dashboard template with some diagrams
# Create a custom dashboard instance for that template and save
# Log out and restart tomcat
# Log in and open the custom dashboard instance

=> Error message like
{quote}
Object of class \[de.iteratec.iteraplan.model.queries.CustomDashboardInstance\] with identifier \[2\]: optimistic locking failed; nested exception is org.hibernate.StaleObjectStateException: Row was updated or deleted by another transaction (or unsaved-value mapping was incorrect): \[de.iteratec.iteraplan.model.queries.CustomDashboardInstance#2\]

Seems to also happen without the tomcat restart, but less likely. It's not 100% with restart either, for me."		Bug	iteraplan PO	12/Feb/14 11:06 AM	13/Feb/14 10:18 AM					dashboard
