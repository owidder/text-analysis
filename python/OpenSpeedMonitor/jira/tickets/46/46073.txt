False positive when trying to create ISR/TCR without release number	"to reproduce:
# create an ISR with name A and release number 1
# create a new release for this IS without release number
=> error

if you first create the release without number, the creation of another ISR with a release number works as expected. This behavior is somehow inconsistent, as the result may or may not be achieved depending on the order of actions taken.

Same applies to creation of TCRs."		Bug	iteraplan PO	18/Sep/13 10:29 AM	30/Dec/15 3:20 PM
