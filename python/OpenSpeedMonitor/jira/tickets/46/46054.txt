Bulk Upload: order of Relations changes when the page is updated	"How to reproduce:

1. Go to Mass Data -> Bulk Upload
2. Now go to e.g. Products and notice the order of the Relations (it seems to happen with other BBTs too, but it's easier to notice with Products, because it has only two relations)
3. Click ""Send Query"", so that all Products are portrayed.
4. Order of Relations has changed
5. Select all and click ""more options"" -> ""Bulk delete [...]""
6. The order of the Relations has changed again

(if it doesn't happen the first time, just create a new Product and try again, for sometimes the bug won't show. If you do it with something with more Relations (e.g. Technical Components) you'll notice, that the order does not return to the original order)"		Bug	iteraplan PO	06/Sep/13 1:00 PM	30/Dec/15 3:17 PM					gui									06/Sep/13 1:09 PM;jmi;I just noticed, that it also happens when you have one or more open elements (OrderTC_openElements) and then close one of it (OrderTC_openElements-FollowUp)
