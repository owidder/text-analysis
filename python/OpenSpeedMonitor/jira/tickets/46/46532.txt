Partial export creates corrupted Excel file	"I have a complex query and want to export its results to Excel. It queries Information Systems and the filter expression is

{code} view(/businessmappings /businessunit@name) = Finance 
| view(/informationFlows1 /informationSystemRelease2 /businessmappings /businessunit@name) = Finance 
| view(/informationFlows2 /informationSystemRelease1 /businessmappings /businessunit@name) = Finance {code}

The download works fine, but Excel complains about a corrupted file as soon as you open the download.

After repairing the file, Excel reports {quote}Entfernte Datens√§tze: Benannter Bereich von /xl/workbook.xml-Part (Arbeitsmappe) {quote}

An adhoc analysis by Stephan showed that probably POI is called incorrectly and/or invalid references are created."		Bug	iteraplan PO	20/Mar/14 5:51 PM	19/Jan/16 11:00 AM					excel	iteraQl	partial
