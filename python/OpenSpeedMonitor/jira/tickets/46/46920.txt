Error when saving Landscape diagram after changing attribute-based association	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_
# Log into iteraplan, navigate to Visualizations->Landscape Diagram
# Load one of the saved queries
# Edit row or column association, select an attribute
# Save the query (same or different name)

_Expected:_ Diagram saved successfully.
_Actual:_ Technical error page, see also attached ProblemReport

_Possible reason:_ Missing or wrong initialization of timeseries query objects when selecting an attribute association. Start investigating in {{LandscapeDiagramFrontendServiceImpl#selectRowType}} or {{..#selectColumnType}} respectively."
