Edit a numeric property	"To the existing single item view of IS, add editing to a numeric property.

Only for 2strategic value"", so we can see a change in the NCDiagram. 

Behavior as for a string/text property, but with validation for a numeric value.
Ignore all keys that are not used for numbers.

Use English number format, with decimal point.

Validate against a lower and upper bound.

In the scope of this ticket: Because we program this for exactly one property, the values of the bounds can be hard coded. Do not look them up in the JSON of the metamodel REST resource, even if they are there."
