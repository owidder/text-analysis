A virtual InformationFlow has no URL field in JSON output	"A virtual InformationFlow (elastic) results from a InformationSystemInterface (classic) without a Transport (classic), that is inserted to connect the two InformationSystems (elastic, ISR classic) with the ISInterface (elastic).

This virtual element needs a deterministic and fresh ID, so that the Bridge takes the negative ID from the ISI. 

The logic to exclude synthetic objects (nullify, power...) from being referenced by URI tests if the ID is negative.
They are excluded, because they do not have a stabel ID and thus no stable URI.

This logic suppresses the URI for virtual objects as well.


Suggestion: Do not fix for 3.2, re-implement JSON for 3.3.


Differential Diagnosis

1) If one builds the URI of a InformationFlow manually with a negative ID, the JSON API returns the JSON description for the element (only without the URI field).

2) All regular, non-virtual InformationFlows work as expected."		Bug	iteraplan PO	29/Nov/13 2:49 PM	01/Jun/15 1:33 PM					elasticeam
