Javascript validation in save button prevents saving too often	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_
# Log into iteraplan and edit attribute ""Costs"" to include lower and upper bounds
# Edit an information system and enter a value for costs which is outside of the new bounds
# Click save

_Expected:_ Successful save, possibly after a confirmation, since while the value entered is out of bounds, we still want to be able to save this state, just mark it as a ""not recommended"" state.

_Actual:_ Clicking the save button does nothing. No save performed, but also no popup, no message, nothing.

_Solution:_
For now, remove the javascript which prevents the save action if there are validation errors.
If there are changes which should not be saved, they are validated server-side anyway, including decently user-friendly messages."		Bug	iteraplan PO	29/Aug/14 11:32 AM	29/Aug/14 1:21 PM					save	validation
