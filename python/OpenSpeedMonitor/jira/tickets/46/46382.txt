Loading a InfoFlow saved query fails without read permissions on BusinessObjects	"Reproduce:
* Login with a user who doesn't have read permissions on BusinessObjects
* Try to load a InformationFlow diagram saved query.
=> ErrorPage

sfe: The error has changed lately, probably due to other changes regarding the information flow diagram.
Now you get a ""You do not have the necessary permission to perform this action."" error message.
Desireable would be to be able to load the information flow diagram, maybe without having any business object information displayed.


was before (NOT the current error):
Stacktrace:

Bug	iteraplan PO	09/Dec/13 3:25 PM	25/Apr/14 8:16 AM					diagram	informationflow	savedquery	visualization						"20/Jan/14 5:38 PM;sfe;Currently it's possible, when creating a new information flow diagram, to select business objects to display and also to create the diagram with business objects displayed.
This is not more information than accessible in other parts of iteraplan: When viewing the detail page for an Information System, assigned Business Objects are visible even without Business Object read permission.

Still: intended behavior in case of the diagram? <= to be clarified"	"27/Jan/14 11:06 AM;sbu;Desired solution would be to load the information flow diagram without business object information (Stage 1). 
Hide configuration menue ""Relevant Business Objects"" (Stage 2).

It must be clarified if the second stage is really neccessary (see remark regarding the visibility of business objects via the information system detail page)."	27/Feb/14 11:26 AM;fka;After consultation wit SBU: Stage 1 is sufficient	22/Apr/14 9:51 AM;bra;reestablished behavior of 3.1 which means that a query without any criteria will be successfully evaluated even if the user has no read permission on the BBT	"23/Apr/14 6:22 PM;fka;Current behaviour in trunk: 
A user without read permission on business objects cannot load a saved query, which includes a filter for business objects. The user can load any other saved query. Moreover, the user can configure a new query with a filter on business objects, execute it and save it.

Expected behaviour:
Load of the saved query should be possible "	25/Apr/14 8:16 AM;bra;closed, as the bug is fixed, improvements in behavior are handled in ITERAPLAN-2473	25/Apr/14 1:28 PM;fka;Okay, thanks.
