Diagrams in custom dashboards show uneven or uncorrect results with empty elements	"Some diagrams
* are not shown at all (ITERAPLAN-2108, ITERAPLAN-2024, ITERAPLAN-2025)
* show only the legend(s): NCD, InfoFlow;  (?) is this the expected behavior?
* Cluster shows a lot of elements (see screenshot) ; used saved query ""2. Strategic areas of our Enterprise Architecture""
* Masterplan shows empty table (see screenshot)
* Pie chart shows empty circle (see screenshot) and ""0 Information Systems""

Shouldn't diagrams behave the same way?"		Bug	iteraplan PO	28/Oct/13 9:53 AM	19/Jan/16 11:33 AM					dashboard	diagram	visualization
