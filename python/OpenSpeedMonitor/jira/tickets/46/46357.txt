Introduce better error handling when importing syntactically incorrect Excel Files	"Example with sample data:

# Open iteraplan
# Export Excel template on _Mass Data -> Export/Import_ page
# Edit Excel file, make lines 3-5 on an arbitrary building block sheet visible by setting their line height to a non-zero value
# Change a feature header in line 4 for an arbitrary attribute to an invalid value, for example:
*Accountability\[0..\*\]:java.lang.String* changed to simple *Accountability*
# Save and then import the Excel file
=> General error page

This happens due to an uncaught exception happening in {{FeatureExpressionReader}}.

It would be better to get a helpful error message like ""Invalid feature header in Cell F4"".

An error like this happened for at least one customer already, but it's still likely a rare case, as it requires manual tampering with the hidden technical information of an Excel template."
