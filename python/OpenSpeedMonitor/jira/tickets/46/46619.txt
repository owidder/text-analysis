Runtime error after consistency check "generate full report"	"The execution of ""generate full report"" of consistency checks leads to a waiting time. After some minutes with a spinning circle in browser, the runtime error appears.

Unfortunately there is no log entry showing more details of the error. Therefor, I attached only the screenshot."		Bug	iteraplan PO	29/Apr/14 1:18 PM	24/Jun/14 1:48 PM														"07/May/14 2:25 PM;gph;Can't reproduce the problem, even with very big data set.

Log messages would be useful. Otherwise it is nearly impossible to guess what went wrong."	08/May/14 8:37 AM;sfr;To be tested again with release 3.3	20/Jun/14 1:06 PM;wfr;Mail to [~sfr] => out of office til 23 Jun	"24/Jun/14 1:48 PM;sfr;Unfortunately the error can not be reproduced in iteratec's test environment and there are no iteraplan logs avbailabke.

The error might relate to the usage of SSO via IIS. Several IIS configuration changes based on MS KB articles could resolve it.

Because a user could use two workarounds, the error has no longer to be analysed. Workarounds are:
- Press F5 after the error and result pages appears
- Execute the consistency checks consecutively instead of all together"
