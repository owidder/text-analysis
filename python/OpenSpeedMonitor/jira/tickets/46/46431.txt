New Permission "Read Plus" for Building Block Types	"Introduce a new permission: ""read plus"" for building block types. It will be evaluated like the traditional ""read"" permission, but can be changed to the traditional ""write"" permission by an (orthogonal) write permission from an attribute group. 
The new permission should be available with building block types only. Orthogonal (traditional) write permissions for certain attribute groups will be able to change the effective permission to write for the respective attribute group."
