Detailed Layout/Design of Diagram	"Create a detailed desigh of the diagram layout and discuss with Demand Management, that is MRe.

Design must have all elements of the diagram under development, that is 
* title
* labels, messages
* names of sample objects
* icons for buidling block types
* date/timestamp line

Design should show the intended layout, that is guidelines, margins, indentations, columns, font sizes and format (A4 portrait)

All static text should be clear in German and English.

Together with the new menu items (in DE/EN) this gives the list of all resource keys and their values."	46567	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	07/May/14 3:49 PM	28/May/14 2:44 PM														09/May/14 11:10 AM;fam;In progress	13/May/14 3:45 PM;fam;Entwurf des Layouts	"19/May/14 1:33 PM;sfe;_Review results:_
Seems fine, but one open question:
As I understand it, the ""date/timestamp line"" mentioned in the issue description is meant to display the creation time of the diagram.
There is no such element in the design, only the Build ID (including build date/time) in the lower right corner.

Please clarify whether this is meant with ""date/timestamp line"" or whether extra information needs to be included into the design, and update the issue description accordingly."	28/May/14 11:39 AM;fam;Layout with modified timestamp attached.	28/May/14 2:44 PM;sfe;looks fine to me
