Update documentation: IE8-Problems with REST	"When trying to GET something from the REST-interface without giving a specific format (like ""\api\data"" instead of ""\api\data?format=xls"") IE 8 will return a 400-error instead of the expected result.
This is due to IE8 not having ""html"" as part of its accept header.

Workaround:
add a format (e.g. ""?format=json"") at the end of the GET url.

Update the documentation accordingly."		Task	iteraplan PO	24/Oct/13 10:25 AM	24/Oct/13 3:58 PM					export								"Win XP
