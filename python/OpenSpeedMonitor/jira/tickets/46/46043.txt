Excel (XLSX) export fails at processing the data	"What steps will reproduce the problem?

1. In Navigation Menu go to Mass Data -> and choose Export/Import
2. Click either on 'Download Template' or 'Download Data' for Excel (XLSX).
 

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?

Browser should prompt me to save the exported file but instead the browser responces with 'An error occurred while processing your request.', without any concrete message why the error occured. 
So, for the data set I'm currently working with the export in Excel XLSX format is impossible.
But, the 'Excel 2003 (XLS)' export/import with the data in question works just fine.
Also Xmi export of the data works as well. 

The data is confidential, so the assignee should contact me.
I can deliver the HSQLDB 'data' folder and/or the 'Excel 2003 (XLS)' exported data file.

Please report back whether that explains the behaviour you described, or whether something else is going on. A stacktrace would then be great."	"06/Nov/13 10:12 AM;bba;Yes, that was exactly the case.

I've tested it again with iteraplan Build ID: Enterprise Edition Build-v3.2.SNAPSHOT-r21690 (2013-10-30-05-22-45) and the xlsx export/import works.

This issue is resolved."	06/Nov/13 10:14 AM;bba;fixed in iteraplan 3.2	06/Nov/13 10:39 AM;sry;Thanks, Becir!
