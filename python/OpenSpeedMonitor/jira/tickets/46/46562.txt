Enable installer to connect to Oracle DB with Service Name	"Currently, the installer builds the Oracle JDBC connection URL with the SID (System ID), using a predefined pattern. This pattern doesn't work with connection URLs which use the Service Name.

The usage of SID is deprecated. For this reason, the installer should be able to handle Service Name connection URLs as well.

Example with SID:
{code}jdbc:oracle:thin:@localhost:1521:orcl{code}

Example with (TNS Format) Service Name:
{code}jdbc:oracle:thin:@(DESCRIPTION=(ADDRESS=(PROTOCOL=TCP)(HOST=localhost)(PORT=1521))(CONNECT_DATA=(SERVER=DEDICATED)(SERVICE_NAME=orcl.myoraclehost.de))){code}


The Oracle service name can usually be looked up in this file:
ORACLE/product/11.2.0/server/network/ADMIN/tnsnames.ora"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	08/Apr/14 11:19 AM	13/Aug/14 12:06 PM					installer	oracle
