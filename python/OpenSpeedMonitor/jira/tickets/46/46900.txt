Download SVG into file	"Add a global action button in the menu bar ""Download SVG"".

When the user clicks the action, the system starts a download, just as for any other download from a server. Depending on the browser settings, the browser may ask for a download directory or use the default directory.

The (local) filename is fixed as 
iteraplan-NestedClusterdiagram-<date/time>
where <date/time> has the format like 2014-09-31-12.20.02
The exact format is less important, it should have a resolution of seconds (not finer) and it should be year-to-second, so the filenames sort correctly by timestamp.


Technical notes:

For the filename, use an <a> element with a download attribute.

For the file content, use a data URI with the data in Base64 encoding.

So the steps to create the download are:
* create the button with a click handler, but not with the data
* collect the svg data as a string (with text or innerHTML of the dom element)
* encode the text in Base64 (Note that this cannot be precomputed, as the icon png data.)
* set the encoded svg text as the value of the href attribute of an <a> element
* click it programmatically.

Note that the button in the menubar and the <a> element with the data href can be the same element, or the <a> element could be extra and hidden. Whatever works better.

Window.atob() should work for our diagrams, because we do not support fancy unicode characters in the text (element names...)
