Show an obvious way to continue after successful excel import	After a successful excel import, the gui only shows one button: "< Back". The caption should be something like "Done" or "Ok". "Back" could be misunderstood as taking back the last step (writing the data). While the import is still in progress, the caption "Back" is also also misleading. It should be "Cancel", as this what it does.		Improvement	iteraplan PO	27/Feb/14 5:59 PM	29/Aug/14 1:46 PM					gui	import
