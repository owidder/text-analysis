existing document templates cannot be deleted in IE9	"When trying to delete a document template IE9 starts the download of the template rather than deleting it... (see attached image).

According to Tobias, IE8 Compatibility Mode fixes the issue."		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/Jul/14 1:14 PM	11/Aug/14 8:52 AM														28/Jul/14 11:34 AM;sfe;Also happens in IE11	"28/Jul/14 11:43 AM;sfe;Seems to be related to how Internet Explorer handles ""label"" tags, as the Name of the template is implemented as label for the download button:
{noformat}
<label class=""control-label-right"" for=""download_reports_export_Excel2007_ExcelWorkbook2.xlsx"">
...
{noformat}
With ""download_reports_export_Excel2007_ExcelWorkbook2.xlsx"" being the html-ID of the download button.

IE9+ apparently executes the download action when clicking on the label, which extends over the ""remove"" icon, while Firefox does not."	"28/Jul/14 2:19 PM;sfe;Click on the template name will no longer trigger a download in IE, use download button instead.
The issue with the removal-link should be fixed now."
