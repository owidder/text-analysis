Rest API does not return multivalued attributes as Collection if there is only one value assigned	"to reproduce:
# ensure the accountability of an informationsystem has only one value assigned
# query the rest api for this informationsystem (e.g. rest/data.json?content=InformationSystem[@name.contains(""Acc"")]; )
=> json contains accountability with just the value (no collection brackets)
# add another value to the accountability attribute
# again query the rest api for this informationsystem
=> json contains both accountability values correctly encoded as collection

To fix this we might need to check the attributes cardinality and explicitly call the getValues(...) on the UniversalModelExpression in case of a multivalued attribute. This ensures a Collection being returned.

Hint on a fix: see AbstractDataSerializer#setProperty. We need to check the cardinality here and append a collection for multivalued properties even if only one value is contained in the values Collection."
