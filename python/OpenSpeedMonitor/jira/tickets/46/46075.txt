Upgrade gxl2visio libary	"Todo:
Upgrade the currently used gxl2visio 1.1 libary to the newest version 1.3.

There are some differences between the libarys.
DocumentFactory has been renamed in DocumentLoader
createNewShape(..) has been renamed in createNewInnerShape(...)
setFieldValue(..) has been removed
setShapeText(String text) is now deprecated instead use setShapeText(ShapeText text)

After upgrading the libary, make sure to test every visio-graphic, and check also for compatibility (2003, 2007, 2010)."		Task	iteraplan PO	18/Sep/13 10:03 AM	30/Dec/15 3:34 PM
