Attribute value changes are sometimes not applied when using IE9	"Reproduce with sample data:
# Open iteraplan in IE9
# Open Information System *Account-Sys RB # 3.1*
# Set {{Complexity}} to *low* and {{System size}} to *big* and save
# Set {{Complexity}} and {{System size}} both to *average* and save
=> In step 3 and/or 4 one or more of the changes may not have been applied. If everything worked correctly, try different changes of those two attributes for a few more times.
