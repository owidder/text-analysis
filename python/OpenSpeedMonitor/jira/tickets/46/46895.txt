Long name of inner box in 2 or 3 lines.	"Break a long name of an element into 2 or 3 lines of text in an inner box in a NCD.

This is only a design/layout improvement, no direct user interaction.

If the text of the inner box is too long, break it into two parts, and display it as two lines of text in the box. 
Make the line break at a space "" "" or a dash ""-"".
The first line must fit into the box and must be as long as possible.

If there is no breaking character in the name that would lead to a fitting first line, then make a hard break after n characters.
Do not try to make orthographical correct word hyphenazation.

For the width of a line, compute an approximation with the width of an ""x"" character.
Do not try to compute the exact width with font metrics.

If the second line is still to long, repeat this step and add a third line of text in the box.

If the third line is still to long, clip it with a clipping path in SVG.
For an example of a clipping path, see the comment in IPNINE-7"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	21/Aug/14 9:28 PM	29/Sep/14 10:14 AM														22/Aug/14 4:18 PM;sepr;Est. 1 PD
