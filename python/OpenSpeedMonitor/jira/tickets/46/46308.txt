Enable Netto-Excel-Export for Building Block Overviews and Spreadsheet Reports	"Spreadsheet reports as well as Building block Overviews already allow users to show a simple list (browser-based) for certain elements that are of interest. These simple lists can be adapted:
* the displayed columns can be selected
* the order of displayed columns can be configured
* the displayed elements can be filtered
* the order of displayed elements can be configured

In the future, users should be able to transfer these simple lists into an exact 1:1 copy in excel-file format, meaning:
* only one sheet
* same amount and order of columns
* same amount and order of elements

The transfer and file-download should be available over a simple button.
There is explicitly no need for those sheets to be re-importable.
Paging from the respective simple list should not play any role in corresponding excel-file.
