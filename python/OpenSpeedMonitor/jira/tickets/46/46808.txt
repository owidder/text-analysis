Unrobust input field with consistency check	"The textbox for consistency checks in section _Consistency Checks - Information System Landscape_ row 3 is not robust for wrong inputs. If, for example the user types in an ""a"", a _NumberFormatException_ occurs. 

This textbox can also used for cross site scripting. If you insert _<script>alert('hi');</script>_, a number format exception occures and the ""wrong string"" is outputted on the screen => alert Popup appears. 

Fix this possible security issue and make the input filed more robust against wrong inputs.
