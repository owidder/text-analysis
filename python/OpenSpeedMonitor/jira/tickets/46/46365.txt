iTURM does not work on MySQL with binary logging enabled	"iTURM fails to create or delete users and roles if the underlying MySQL DB has the system option {{log_bin}} enabled and {{binlog_format}} is set to {{STATEMENT}}. Each such operation causes following error message:
{quote}
Beim Kommunizieren mit der Datenbank ist ein Fehler aufgetreten. Mehr
java.sql.SQLException: Cannot execute statement: impossible to write to binary log since BINLOG_FORMAT = STATEMENT and at least one table uses a storage engine limited to row-based logging. InnoDB is limited to row-logging when transaction isolation level is READ COMMITTED or READ UNCOMMITTED.
{quote}

The reason is that class {{BaseDao}} contains a statement to increase the tx isolation level
{code}conn.setTransactionIsolation(Connection.TRANSACTION_READ_COMMITTED);{code}

Given the simplicity of iTURM, setting an increased tx isolation level is sheer overkill.

While fixing that class, also look into simplifying the whole datasource handling with default Spring tools."

This simplifies the whole datasource handling quite a bit and makes it easier to read and maintain.	"07/Mar/14 1:28 PM;gph;Could reproduce the problem and the solution.
Code looks good."
