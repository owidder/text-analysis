IIS SSO configuration: login name is not always correctly extracted from request header	"In our SSO configuration iteraplan relies on the login name of the authenticated user being sent as value of a request header field.
A typical value for that field is {{DOMAIN\login_name}}.

iteraplan then separates the login name from the DOMAIN to perform a LDAP search for the user.

For some values of {{login_name}} this separation doesn't work, as the code in {{RequestHeaderAuthenticationFilterWithSuccessHandler}} assumes the login name only consists of ""word"" characters, meaning alphanumeric or underscore characters.

Fix this so login with values like {{DOMAIN\firstname.lastname}}, containing dots or other non-word characters, work as well."

The regex pattern for the user principal name now finds all characters and not only alphanumeric characters like before.
