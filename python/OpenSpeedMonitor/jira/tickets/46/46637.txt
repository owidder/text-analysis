ElasticMI and iteraplan UI have a different understanding of uniqueness of enumeration attribute values	"In iteraplan it is possible to create, for a single enumeration attribute, multiple attribute values which are only different in their case.
Example:
# Create new enumeration attribute
# Create attribute values ""TEST"" and ""test""
# Save
=> Successful

ElasticMI model load throws an exception in this case, however, as it interprets those values case-insensitive. See where in {{WNominalEnumerationExpressionImpl#createEnumerationLiteral}} {{#findLiteralByPersistentName}} is called.

The behavior here should be consistent, so make iteraplan check for duplicate enumeration value names in a case insensitive manner, too.
The alternative to adjust elasticMI in this regard most likely should be avoided."		Bug	iteraplan PO	09/May/14 11:34 AM	21/May/14 10:34 AM					elasticmi									"09/May/14 1:41 PM;fka;iteraplan should check for enumeration attributes, do not adjust elasticMI.

Please provide a SQL migration script (to be included in the general 3.4 migration script), which
diagnoses if the problem is existent in the current dataset
fixes the problem by changing the attribute values (append ""_1"", ""_2"")
reports to the user that both things have happend

Please update the user documentation."	"14/May/14 5:42 PM;gph;How should existing inconsistencies be handled in the GUI?
If multiple enum literals with equals=false and equalsIgnoreCase=true exist (like ""high"" and ""High""), and the enum is edited and saved, should there be a warning for these existing literals?
Or shall only new literals be prevented from adding & saving?"	"15/May/14 10:31 AM;sfe;In my opinion, saving should not be possible if there are conflicting literals, whether they were newly created or already existing.
The latter case should not happen anyway, if the migration is done properly with the script Fabian mentioned above."	"20/May/14 9:58 AM;gph;Current solution appends ""_"" and position value, because it is much easier to implement.
This means that the numbers may not be consecutive. It can be ""_2"" and ""_5"" or something like that."
