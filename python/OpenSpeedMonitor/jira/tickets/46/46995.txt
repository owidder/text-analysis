Smooth rendering of context menus in list view	"The context menu in the list view should appear without changing the layout of the rest of the view.

When the user clicks a column header in the list view, the header row and the list below ""jumps"": it is rendered with more height temporarily.

Note that this jumping happens also when the menu is dismissed and disappears."	47009	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	29/Sep/14 11:24 AM	09/Jun/15 5:06 PM
