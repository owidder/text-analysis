Print output shouldn't contain link URLs	"When printing building block pages, next to associated elements and to attribute types and other html links, the URL they link to is displayed.

This causes the printing of building blocks with many associated building blocks to become cluttered with links and hard to read.

Please remove the display of the URLs.

Cause:
CSS style in bootstrap.css
{noformat}
@media print {
  ...
  a[href]:after {
    content: "" ("" attr(href) "")"";
  }
  ...
