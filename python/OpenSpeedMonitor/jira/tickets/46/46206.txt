Exporting the Excel (XLSX) template fails immediately	"Exporting the Excel (XLSX) template fails immediately, with the generic failure message:

An error occurred while processing your request.

Possible reasons:

You pressed a link or button several times without allowing time for your request to be processed.
You tried to access a link that is not valid in the current session. In particular, URLs ending in ""?execution=e4s2"" are only valid within one session.
A general technical error occurred from which the application could not recover.
The current menu point flow was closed in order to prevent inconsistencies or data corruption. If the problem persists, you may also try to log off and on again.

Exporting the Excel (XLSX) template fails immediately"	"24/Oct/13 3:55 PM;sry;Thank you very much for reporting this issue. A fix will be shipped in iteraplan 3.2 shortly.

The underlying reason is that you have at least one enumeration attribute with no values defined. As a workaround, you can go through all your enumeration attributes and add at least one dummy value."	"24/Oct/13 4:18 PM;laird;Thanks, I have many enumerations, and they are not set unless I know the value. I could add a ""TBD"" to every enumeration and set all of the ""no value"" entries to ""TBD"" but as have tens of thousands of records, and dozens of enumerations, that would be extremely time consuming (it might be faster to wait for 3.2 to be released).

Can you suggest an alternative that's faster/easier?"	25/Oct/13 11:42 PM;laird;There's a work-around, using the old binary Excel format. So less of an emergency than I originally thought, and it's no longer a blocker.
