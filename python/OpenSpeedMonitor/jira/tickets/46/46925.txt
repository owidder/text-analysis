Single information system view	"Add a screen with a view of a single information system. Note that in the scope of this ticket, the user cannot edit the information. Editing will be added in later tickets.

Follow the design sketches from the beginning of the project. Most important: 
* no border lines
* different shades of background color for grouping
* align label text right and value text left, so that the "": "" (colon and space) part is centered in one column
* make it a two-column layout in the scope of this ticket. 

Note that the two-column layout is for the smaller projector screen and not optimal for a wide screen. A more fluent and responsive layout could be added in a ticket later.

Sequence of events:

* The user can click the name of a information system in the list view.
* The system displays the information system in the single item view.
* The user can go back to the list view via the back button in the menu bar, or he can go to the home screen.

The user can expand or collapse the groups, as in Tanya's design sketch.
Initially, all groups are expanded.
(Note that we will refine this, so that some groups may be collapsed initially, but this comes later). "		New Feature	iteraplan PO	05/Sep/14 6:12 PM	29/Sep/14 10:28 AM														09/Sep/14 10:40 AM;sepr;Est. 3 PD	"10/Sep/14 10:48 AM;sepr;Small change:
