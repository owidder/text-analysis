Enable coloring of enum attributes in nesting cluster visualizations	While determining colors is already available for numeric attributes, coloring enum attributes when creating nesting cluster diagrams is not possible so far. It should be possible to set the color of existing enum attributes when configuring elements. 		New Feature	iteraplan PO	23/Aug/13 7:09 PM	08/Oct/13 9:41 AM														05/Sep/13 3:53 PM;sbu;Does enum in this sense include "accountability"?	05/Sep/13 5:45 PM;lba;No, because "accountability" is a "Responsibility Attribute".	02/Oct/13 7:24 PM;kgo;Left TODO: The drop button should look pressed when the default static coloring is changed, or an attribute is selected for coloring.	04/Oct/13 10:47 AM;bra;radio buttons are not correctly initialized when loading a legacy saved query. This might be because the optional_coloring within the vpConfigMap is neither null nor empty but "undefined"	07/Oct/13 6:25 PM;psc;As discussed and agreed with Sabine Buckl, for objectified Elements so far (as concerns this ticket) only static coloring will be implemented.	07/Oct/13 6:30 PM;psc;As discussed and agreed with Sabine Buckl, the "orphan"-cluster introduced by ITERAPLAN-1889 should always be colored with the default color of particular element (inner/outer). This behavior should be independent of determined color configurations.	"08/Oct/13 6:30 PM;psc;Reviewed. Coloring works as expected.
Some remarks:
* Currently no legends are shown for statically colored elements
* The legends ordering would be more intuitive, if the first displayed legend would concern the outer element, if two legends are displayed
* The ordering of legend-entries seems to be reversed compared to the configuration list
* Currently, there is no hint on the main config page whether the current color configuration differs from the standard configuration
* Sometimes - when using dark cluster colours - the text on the cluster cannot be read anymore, since the font-color is not set automatically relative to the cluster colour.

These minor improvements will be adressed in dedicated tickets."	09/Oct/13 5:29 PM;psc;In accordance with Demand-Management, this ticket only cared for the coloring of enum attributes. Coloring for "responsibility", as a special case attribute type, needs to be adressed in a dedicated ticket.
