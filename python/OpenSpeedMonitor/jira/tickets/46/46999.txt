If in a group an item is selected, the ""reset"" action, for example ""No filter"" is shown.

The selected item, for example ""High"" in ""Show only complexity"" is marked as selected, for example with a tick mark.

((2)) The menu item ""Highlight"" is replaced by ""Remove highlight"", if the current item is highlighted.

The item ""Remove all highlights"" is only shown if there are one or more hightlights in the diagram. Initially, it is not shown.
