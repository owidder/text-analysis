Include separate AtomicDataType.DateTime	"Currently, the elasticMi core contains the AtomicDataType as a single representation of date and dateTime. This implies the parallell usage of this DataType for both
* Dates with a daily granularity (e.g. Project.rolloutDate)
* Dates with a granularity of (milli/)seconds (e.g. *.lastModificationTime)

In order to provide a clear separation of these data types, we should 
# add a second DataType (like ""Time"", ""DateTime"", or sth. similar)
# ensure a consistent usage among the elasticMi modules"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	14/Jan/14 3:33 PM	23/Jan/14 10:04 AM					core	elasticmi	valuetype							23/Jan/14 1:23 PM;fka;Ticket closed
