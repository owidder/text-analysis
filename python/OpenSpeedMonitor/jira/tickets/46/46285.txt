Nesting cluster: Coloring dialog cannot be closed	The dialog for coloring inner elements of a nesting cluster diagram cannot be closed from a small browser window. The "Close"-button is too far at the bottom, and scrolling affects only the general diagram configuration in the background. The "X"-button at the top is missing.
