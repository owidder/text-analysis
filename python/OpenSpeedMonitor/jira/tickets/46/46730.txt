Home screen - Design	"Home screen is a mix of a android home screen and a Windows modern homescreen:

* scrolls horizontally
* has tiles, boxes with small images of recent views in a group
* has tiles in different groups

A tile for a recent view should combine:
* a thumbnail image of the view itself
* an icon for the category of the view: 
** if it is a list or a single item view, the icon from the (old) start screen
** if it is a diagram, a (new) icon for the diagram. => we need an icon for nested  cluster diagram.
** if it is something else, even more new icons (favorites, users, ...) , BUT not now in the scope of this ticket
* the icon (or the full tile or both) could have a background color that indicates the architecture area: yellow for business, red for information system,  
* the title of the view and/or the element, for example ""Account-Sys #3.14"" or ""Information Systems"" or ""Nested Clluster Diagram"" or ""Current ISs and BOs"".

All tiles have the same size. (as opposed to Windows, where more important or more recent tiles are bigger)


Idea, not a requirement:

relatively large thumbnail image as the background, of the tile
Colors and contrast of thumbnail corrected towards a light grey
Forground: icon for category, icon has logical area color, and title of the view

on hover, thumbnail image goes back to original colors and contrast, text fades out to invisible"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	09/Jul/14 3:37 PM	06/Oct/14 11:33 AM														"06/Oct/14 11:33 AM;wfr;Ticket successfully done.
