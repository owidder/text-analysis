Wiki Syntax other than XWIKI does not work	"_Reproduce:_
# Change the value of property {{wiki.syntax}} in file _iteraplan.properties_ to something different than {{XWIKI}}, for example {{CONFLUENCE}} (see also comment in the file).
# Start iteraplan
# Edit a building block and enter wiki formatted text into the description field, then save

_Expected:_ The text is rendered according to the selected wiki syntax
_Actual:_ Values other than XWIKI lead to warn messages in the log, stating the according parser could not be found. Text is displayed as entered, without formatting (for example {{\*text\*}} instead of *{{text}}* (strong))

_Fix:_ Remove the property to set wiki syntax (and related code), only support XWIKI from now on."		Bug	iteraplan PO	17/Sep/14 12:57 PM	22/Sep/14 10:35 AM					syntax	wiki
