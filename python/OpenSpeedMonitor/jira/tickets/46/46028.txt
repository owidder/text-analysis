Same Memory Bean used in different Tabs in Iteraplan	"To Reproduce:
- Go to DateIntervals
- create new DateInterval
- open new Tab also with ""create new DateInterval""
- Configure and save one DI
- now try to save the other one
---> NPE

Expected Behaviour:
- User should be able to save the 2nd DI too

Investigate:
- This problem occurs because the user accesses the same memory bean
- Investigate if the problem occurs on different pages in iteraplan"		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Aug/13 5:49 PM	30/Dec/15 3:17 PM					concurrency	dateinterval
