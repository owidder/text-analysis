Import: cycle checks not executed in first import step	"The current implementation of the {{ModelValidator}} performs, among others, checks for cycles in self referencing relationships which are marked as acyclic. Found cycles are reported as violations.

Since the acyclic-flag is *not* represented in the Excel template, relationships like {{parent-children}}, {{used-uses}} and {{generalization-specialization}} do not have this flag set in the metamodel which is built from the Excel file.
Therefore the cycle checks are not performed.
Whether the same issue exists for the XMI import needs to be ascertained.

This is of low severity, as the checks will be performed in the 4th import step, where we have an updated metamodel with the correct flags.

Enabling the check in the first step could improve user feedback, however, as cycles would be reported sooner.
It'd be also possible for the user to distinguish between import files which contain a whole cycle (reported in first step) and import files which close a cycle only together with existing data (reported in fourth step)."

The problem has _priority_ trivial, because the constraint is checked, only later as possible.

The solution is not that easy: Add metamodel info to Excel format, or (better);
use the constraints of the ""real"" metamodel for validiation in step 1.
