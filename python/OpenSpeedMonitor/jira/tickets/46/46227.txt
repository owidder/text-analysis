Nesting Cluster Graphics / iteraQL has problems with special character in attribute names	"I created attributes with following characters in the name: “(){}[]~;”
The creation and use in buildingblocks worked without problems.
But if I want to use the attributes in a nesting cluster graphic, I get the following error message:
{{The entered query is not syntactically correct: mismatched input '(' expecting NAME}}
