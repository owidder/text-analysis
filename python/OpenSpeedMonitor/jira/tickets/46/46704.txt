Save / Save as for queries can not be used to change name or description	"With the current implementation of Save / Save as for queries it is not possible to change the name or the description of an query without providing a new ID for this element. This could be a problem, because the ID of a query is used in the custom dashboard. So if the user would like to change the name of a query, it has to be invoked the ""Save as"" Function which provides a new ID -> the ID in the custom dashboard must be updated manually.
In order to prevent this, extend the ""Save as"" function. There are two possibilities:
1. Show the same dialog for save as it would be shown for Save but with predefined values. 
2. Show two extra textboxes / textareas in the editing section of a query where the name or description can be changed.
Discuss this issue with wfr first!

*Solution decided by [~fka], [~wfr], [~dop]:*

* ""Save"" displays the same save popup as ""Save as""
* In both cases, the input fields have predefined values, but in case ""Save as"" the name has the prefix ""Copy of""
* Above the name input field a message shows an hint, which action will be performed (""Save as will create a new copy .."", ""Save will update the currently loaded query.."" 
* The button in the save popup is renamed to ""Save""
* The title of the save popup is either ""Save Query"" or ""Save Query as"""		Improvement	iteraplan PO	26/Jun/14 1:07 PM	27/Aug/14 5:38 PM					diagram	query	report	tabular						"30/Jun/14 12:05 PM;frank.reiter;I was just going to write the same request, although I have a slightly different use case.

While building up a set of visualizations I initially had no firm naming rules. As a result I had to rename visualizations later to achieve a consistent naming. This is currently a cumbersome process of creating copies with new names and then deleting the old version. 

It would be great if visualizations would be treated the same way as building blocks, which can be created, edited (which includes changing the name) and copied (which creates a new instance)"	23/Jul/14 3:04 PM;frank.reiter;Thanks! The now chosen approach provides the desired functionality, but in a different manner than it's done for building blocks. A consistent way throughout iteraplan how to deal with "save / save as / edit / copy" actions would improve the usability of iteraplan even further. 	23/Jul/14 5:24 PM;fka;Providing the functionality in a more consistent way throughout the whole GUI/iteraplan will be done later - in a bigger context.	11/Aug/14 8:11 AM;dop;@Reviewer: Please test also if javascript or "illegal characters" in name and description of a saved query leads to errors. 	"12/Aug/14 11:50 AM;frank.reiter;I just found that iteraplan 3.3.1 already went a step towards this direction, but incompletely: 

* ""Save query"" - does not show any action anymore. I guess the visualization gets saved, but iteraplan does not respond in any way nor does it allow to change the name or description of a visualization.

* ""Save query as ..."" shows the known dialog but without predefined fields in case of an existing field. I guess this might create a new query, but all values always have to entered newly.

I definitely prefer to solution described above over what is now available in 3.3.1. Just today I tried to correct a typo in the description of a visualization but failed due to the new UI."	"12/Aug/14 12:39 PM;dop;@[~frank.reiter] 
I implemented the behavior described above. A click on ""Save"" shows a save dialog with input fields for name and description. The values for these input fields are filled with the predefined values of the query. A hint text also explains what will be happened if the save button of the popup is pressed. 

""Save as"" shows the same dialog and also fills the input fields with the predefined value, but the name consists of a copy prefix (""Kopie von "" / ""Copy of "") and the previous name. After clicking save, the query will be saved under the new name. 

If you create a completely new query, only the ""Save as"" option is available, but with empty name and description fields. 

Please have a look at the attached screenshots. 
"	"12/Aug/14 12:48 PM;frank.reiter;This looks very good (and quite different to the solution in 3.3.1)!

Just to be 100% sure: If I use ""save"" to update a visualization and then change the name of the visualization, the system will still treat that as one visualization, but now with a new name, right?"	12/Aug/14 12:54 PM;dop;Yes, technically the query stays the same (same unique id, etc) only the name and the description will be updated. No new query is created with "Save", only with "Save as". 	12/Aug/14 12:58 PM;frank.reiter;Perfect, many thanks!	20/Aug/14 2:13 PM;isc;After clicking "save query as..." the current configuration is loaded but the button "save" is disabled. I have to reopen first the configuration again so that "save" is activated. 	"27/Aug/14 5:38 PM;gph;Solution works as expected.
Docu looks good."
