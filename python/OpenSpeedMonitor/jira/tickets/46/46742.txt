Remove limitation of date intervals, that each date attribute can only be used once	"Currently, when a date attribute is used in a date interval, then it can't be used in another date interval. It was implemented in this way to avoid cycles in validation checks.

For example:
date attributes: ""A"", ""B""
date interval 1:  ""A"" to ""B""  (=> ""A"" should be before ""B"")
date interval 2:  ""B"" to ""A""  (=> ""B"" should be before ""A"")
This usage will lead to an error, no matter which date values are entered.

This drawback is considered smaller than the limitation, that each date attribute can only be used once. Therefore it should be changed in a sensible way.
