Update of multivalue attribute value in interface not possible	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_
# Navigate to iteraplan -> Mass Data -> Export/Import
# Download Excel Data
# Open Excel file and change a value of attribute ""Data exchange"" on the Interfaces sheet (for example from ""Online"" to ""On demand batch job"")
# Save and import into iteraplan with additive strategy

_Expected:_ The interface shows both values, ""Online"" and ""On demand batch job"", as the import was with additive strategy.

_Actual:_ Technical error page in step 5 of the import, related to a unique constraint violation."		Bug	iteraplan PO	02/May/14 3:02 PM	07/May/14 1:26 PM					import
