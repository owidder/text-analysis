Cannot create custom dashboard templates	"Reproduce (with sample data as system):
# iteraplan -> Administration -> document templates
# At the bottom, in the dashboard templates section, select an arbitrary building block type, for example Architectural Domain
# Click ""Create new Dashboard Template""
# Save the template and choose an arbitrary name when prompted for it

_Expected:_ New dashboard template with chosen name is created.
_Actual:_ Cryptic error page.

_Reason:_ It seems the cause is a {{NullPointerException}}, after clicking ""Create new Dashboard Template"" the page is reloaded, so the init method in {{TemplatesController}} calles {{#initCustomDashboardDialogMemory}} which, among other things, sets the custom dashboard template in the dialog memory to null.
When saving (or performing other actions with a ""submit""), the attempt to set name and other properties for the custom dashboard template cause the {{NullPointerException}}.

I noticed that the bug only happened for me, and only when I tried to create the dashboard template with iteraplan running in a tab of my firefox window. When trying to reproduce the bug after drag 'n dropping the browser tab with iteraplan into an extra browser window, it didn't occur. The bug happened again after dragging the extra browser window back into the original one.
After a browser restart the bug vanished alltogether."		Bug	iteraplan PO	16/Jul/14 1:52 PM	16/Jul/14 4:53 PM					dashboard
