Visualization: default temporary-file directory doesn't exists	"When I create a diagram I get the following error message and a broken graphic (contains an error page):

The problem is only on my local Tomcat.
If I use the WTP Tomcat, the problem does not occur.
"		Bug	iteraplan PO	22/Oct/13 12:17 PM	22/Oct/13 4:32 PM					visualization									"22/Oct/13 2:38 PM;psc;As discussed with Ingo:
* Issue does not come up with 3.1 on the same system
* It seems that creation of local temporary file is causing the problem
* see code checked in for ITERAPLAN-1732"	"22/Oct/13 3:09 PM;sry;This problem cannot be related to ITERAPLAN-1732, because the exception is _also_ thrown while a QR code is generated - that code has not been touched for quite some time.

My guess is rather that there is a problem with either environment variables or file system permissions. Java always tries to create temp file in that directory that is specified by the system property {{java.io.tmpdir}}, which is typically the Tomcat temp directory."	"22/Oct/13 4:32 PM;isc;At the start of the Tomcats, the property {{java.io.tmpdir}} is set to {{<tomcat path>/temp}}.
In my configuration, the folder did not exist. That was the reason for the problem.
