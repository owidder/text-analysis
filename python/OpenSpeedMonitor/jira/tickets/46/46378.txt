Task	iteraplan PO	05/Dec/13 11:33 AM	02/Jan/14 5:33 PM														06/Dec/13 11:41 AM;jmi;FYI: I stared a wiki-entry on how to write a Selenium-test: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/display/iwiki/Recipe%3A+How+to+write+a+Selenium+test	"02/Jan/14 1:11 PM;lba;Change the WebDriverWait to Object.
Documentation of the testscenario is to short and not comprehensible. (Appearantly it is not that necessary)
Some private methods are called with local variables which never change. Change the variables to class variables and remove the parameters in the methods."	"02/Jan/14 4:06 PM;jmi;Comment for changeset  22000 (02/Jan/14 3:56 PM):
I also changed the local-variables to class-variables as suggested, updated the testsheet a little and fixed a typo in the SeleniumAssertion-class."	09/Jan/14 6:52 PM;fka;Reviewed with JMI
