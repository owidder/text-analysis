As a first step: Analyse and test, how iteraplan in its current state supports using Oracle 12. Determine limitations when using Oracle 12 resp. things to change in iteraplan to be able to use Oracle 12."

- install and use

Some of the ideas for more analysis and more pre-release observation are still open."
