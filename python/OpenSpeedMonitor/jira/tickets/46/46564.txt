Technical Exception when deleting value in cell of defining end of relator and importing with additive strategy	"I get an error when I try to delete an information system from a business mapping and import with the excel sheet with additive strategy. 

*Reproduce:*
# Navigate to iteraplan -> Mass Data -> Export/Import
# Download Excel data
# Edit Excel file: remove the Information System in one row of the Business Mapping sheet
# Import with additive strategy

In step 4, I get the information that an information system is changed.
In step 5, I get a technical exception. See attached error report (generated by removing an IS from an IS-to-BO relation)

The problem is not only limited to Information Systems that can be reproduced also with the other elements in a business mapping.

*Expected:*
Message, that the deletion will be ignored. No error."		Bug	iteraplan PO	08/Apr/14 10:52 AM	25/Apr/14 5:03 PM					import	permissions								25/Apr/14 5:03 PM;lba;Importer now works as expected
