Add column in list view	"To the existing list view of information systems, add the function to add a new column.

(0) Initially, the system displays a list of elements with the already defined columns.
(1) The user clicks the button ""Add column"".
(2) The system displays a list of possible columns, that is all properties of information system not yet displayed as a column.
(3) The user selects one.
(4) The system adds the column on the rightmost position and displays the values.

Note that other properties in the list have a different, more complex structure from the properties displayed so far:
* A property can have multiple values. Show them as a comma-separated list, maybe broken into two or more lines, if the column is narrow.
* A property can be a list of (directly) connected elements. Show the list of the element names, each name in a new line. 
* A property can be a list of indirectly connected elements with attributes, specifically: Business Object with CRUD: In the scope of this ticket: do not show the association attributes, here CRUD.
* A property can be a list of tuples of indirectly connected elements of different types, specifically Business Mapping: In the scope of this ticket: do not show this column, because it is way to complicated for a list view.

Note that move/reorder or delete column is not in scope of this ticket."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	17/Sep/14 5:39 PM	29/Sep/14 10:42 AM														18/Sep/14 9:47 AM;sepr;Est. 2.5 PD
