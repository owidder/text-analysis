Immediate response after starting an import (step)	"Implement the improvement suggested in DM-495:
Starting each import step will resulting in an immediated server response, the page should show ""in progress"" for the step. Update the page if the step has been finished, using polling.

The status should also be visible if the user visited other areas of the application and comes back to the import (progress) page.

Progress bar (prio 2 in the demand) is not in scope of this ticket.

In greater detail:
* Only one import process triggered by the UI can be active at the same time. Don't change how imports handled by REST-requests are treated.
* Instead of {{ImportProcessRegistry}} which still handles imports via REST, another bean should be responsible for handling the single possible ui-triggered import.
* {{MassdataMemBean}} no longer has a field for importProcessId and uses above mentioned ""getCurrentImport""-method and ""createUiTriggeredImportProcess"" instead.
* When the import page is accessed *without* another import running, everything should behave as it does now.
* Starting an import or continuing with the next import step should return an immediate response (in first step after the file upload) while the step is processed in the background (see {{java.util.concurrent.Callable}}, {{java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService}}; Example: {{ElasticMiLoader}} and {{ElasticMiLoadTask}}).
* The page should be updated using polling to notify the user of status changes (like when one step finished).
* When the import page is accessed *with* another import running, instead of the file upload section a ""see current import status"" link/button should be displayed.
* Click on that link should open the import progress page, displaying the current status just as when starting the import oneself."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	05/Sep/14 3:42 PM	07/Oct/14 8:00 AM					import
