Edit self relationship "sub information system".	"In the existing single item view of information systems, add editing of the list of sub information systems.

(0) In the view mode, the system shows a list of names of connected sub informatation systems. This list can be empty. If so, the system shows a placeholder ""no sub information systems"".

(1) The user clicks a name in the list or the placeholder ""no sub information systems"".

(2) The system shows the list in edit mode as a two part list:
* the list of connected sub IS, with a delete button to the right
* a scrollable list of not connected sub IS, with a filter input box on top, right of the original list, overlapping elements of the screen.

(3) The user can click the delete button or click the name in the candidate list. In both cases, the system updates shows both lists.

Note that the ""sub/super IS"" relation is a hierarchy without cycles.
So if the user selects an element as a new sub IS A that is a parent or ancestor of the current IS B, the system displays a warning:

""Disconnects C as sub system from A to break cycle"".

... and asks for a confirmation.
If the user confirms, the system adds the IS and breaks the cycle.
If not, the system does not add the IS and leaves the sub IS of the candidate IS as it is.

""C"" is the name of the direct child of A that leads to the currently edited IS B. Note that in a small circle, C and B can be the same IS. In this case, the content of ""is sub information system of: "" changes."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	17/Sep/14 2:53 PM	29/Sep/14 10:39 AM														18/Sep/14 9:44 AM;sepr;Estimation 5 PD.
