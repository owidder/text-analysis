Global search not available after mass delete	After execution of a mass delete the global search is not available. E.g., four IS all beginning with "Massentest" are deleted via mass delete. After searching for "Massentest" in the global search and clicking "search" a 404 page appears. This effect can be reproduced. As a workaround the sesion can be cleaned before using the search function.
