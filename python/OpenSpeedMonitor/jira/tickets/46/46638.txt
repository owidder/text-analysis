Improve LDAP authentication error messages	"Whenever an authentication fails, a clear error message should be displayed in the log, indicating the party responsible for the error.

For example, in an SSO configuration, if the necessary token is missing during authorization, a ""token was not provided"" error should be shown, indicating that the problem lies outside iteraplan."
