Edit date fields in "productive" with date picker	"To the existing single item view, add editing for the two date values in ""productive ... until ....""

The editing should work as in every other field, with the addition:

When the system displays the date as input field, it shows a date picker calendar component. 
The user can either click a date in the calendar, or he can edit the text in the input field. 

In both cases, the value is validated against the other date, so that both dates are in the correct order: start before or equal to end.

The text input field must accept only valid characters, that is numbers and slash ""/"". It must ignore, for example, characters a to z and decimal points.

If a field is currently invalid, the user may leave it and modify the other date field. This modification must trigger a re-validation of the first date field, so that an error message is no longer displayed if both dates are valid and in valid order."
