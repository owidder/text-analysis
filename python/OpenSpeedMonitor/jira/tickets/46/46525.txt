Import via REST: Include metamodel changes	"Current behaviour (trunk): Metamodel changes aren't considered when using the excel import via REST

Expected behaviour: As in release 3.2 and identical to using the GUI import with option ""Include Metamodel changes"" enabled: Always consider the (current possible) metamodel changes.

No option needed, just change the default behaviour. And update the documentation."		Bug	iteraplan PO	13/Mar/14 8:08 PM	07/Apr/14 11:34 AM					REST									04/Apr/14 3:06 PM;bra;metamodel changes are considered as well in trunk.	"07/Apr/14 11:34 AM;gph;Test setup 1:
