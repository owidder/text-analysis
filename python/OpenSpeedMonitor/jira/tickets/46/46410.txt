Serialize R-MM (MI) to JSON	"The Metamodel must be serialized to the same JSON format as in 3.2, but based on the MI R-MM instead of the EAM MM.

Based on: existing GSON type adapter by MBa based on the EAM MM.

JSON output format: see User Guide and existing 3.2 behavior.

Replaces the concept of a MM-Mapper as in ITERAPLAN-2159, ITERAPLAN-2161, ITERAPLAN-2202 
A Metamodel is _not_ mapped (that is read and written) the same way as a Model is."

Additionally, the possible (and public available) values for this type-field have been added to the [REST API Resource Structure|http://www.iteraplan.de/wiki/display/upcomingIteraplan/REST+API+Resource+Structure] in the UserGuide."
