Business Domain - update with cylce in hierarchy (superordinate = subordinate)	"Experienced Behavior:
An already existing Business Domain having the same Business Domain as a superordinate and a subordinate is edited. When clicking on save the already entered data (even if changed) is kept. The subordinate element is already ""added"" in the GUI (although not persisted in the database); the superordinate element is still not added but displayed in the dropdown.

Expected Behavior:
Subordinate and superordinate elements are displayed in the dropdown but not ""added"" in the GUI as the user has to change at least one of them."		Bug	iteraplan PO	15/Oct/13 11:07 AM	21/Oct/13 11:16 AM					cycle									17/Oct/13 9:40 AM;aer;@ [~pzi] Could you please clarify this issue. I think I don't really get it. How do you produce a Business Domain that has the same Business Domain as a superordinate as well as a subordinate?	"21/Oct/13 11:16 AM;aer;I do not see a problem here. Since there is only one superordinate possible a selection box is an easy way to achieve this. There can be several subordinates that may be selected. The GUI element to add one by one is probably a bit misleading as it might appear to the user that a (pre-selected) subordinate was already added and stored. Hitting the _Save_ button is the actual action that checks and saves the subordinates.

This is more of a GUI design issue and you will find this behavior in several locations of iteraplan where that GUI component is used, e.g., everywhere where several items can be selected."	21/Oct/13 11:16 AM;aer;This is not to be classified as a bug, this is intended behavior.	24/Oct/13 7:07 PM;sry;True, this is a non-issue
