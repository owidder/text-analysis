Oracle DB allows names which are only different in case	"_Reproduce with iteraplan using oracle database:_

 # Navigate to iteraplan -> Infrastructure Elements

 # Create IE named ""TEST"" and save

 # Create IE named ""test"" and save



_Expected:_ Error message about duplicate names.



_Actual:_ Element is created.



Possible fix is to control the NLS_COMP and NLS_SORT variable of the oracle DB session either by configuration, or possibly from iteraplan (investigate possibilities in hibernate etc.).



{color:#ff0000}UPDATE: {color}not only Infrastructure Elements, but all BBts, attributes,... everywhere, where user can input a name in iteraplan (e.g. user names must not be handled)

 We need check-scripts for existing databases with entries in mixed case."		Improvement	iteraplan Thunderduck	16/Apr/14 11:44 AM						oracle
