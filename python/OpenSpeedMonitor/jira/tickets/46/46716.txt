Extension of selenium test for NCD	"A large part of the NCD test cases, which are documented in the Excel was covered with Seleniumtest. 

Expand the Seleniumtests so that as 100% of the NCD test cases will be covered from the Excel.
* Take existing manual test construction (that is Excel) as a basis. Implement these test cases, if nothing prevents test automation.
* Test should be able to run on both the existing implementation and the new one. Run tests with feature toggle in both settings.
* Test must run successfully on existing implementations.
* Test must tolerate expected differences in new implementations. For example: no objectified types for @id.
* Test must fail on unexpected differences.

Look again on the existing test whether something can be refactored.
