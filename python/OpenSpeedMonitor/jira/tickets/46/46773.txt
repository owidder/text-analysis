List of Information Systems - basic design	"Add a basic implementation of a list of information systems.

When the user clicks the tile ""Infomation Systems"", the system must display this screen.

The browser address changes accordingly from .../index.html to .../informationSystems.html

The list contains all elements (rows) of the type information system that are read from the local iteraplan server.
The controller for this screen uses the data access methods of the model that are defined in IPNINE-13.

In the first steps of this ticket, the content of the screen may be mocked by a hard coded list in JS.
Finally, in the scope of this ticket, the external data must be used.

The visual design can be preliminary in the scope of this ticket.
It must follow the structure of the visual design:
* menu bar as designed with 2 global actions ""Nesting Cluster"" and ""Download"". 
* use background colors for structuring, not lines
* use mostly gray or grayish colors
* use the Bootstrap style classes from a generated Bootstrap theme.
* the rows have different height, depending on the length of the description text.
* The description text is truncated (clipped) after three lines.

The following changes and additions with respect to the visual design must be implemented:
* Information Systems must be capitalized in  ""49 Information Systems""
* The 49 is the actual number of lines
* the bright orange button ""Edit columns"" should be a regular button. Bright orange is only to demonstrate ""acitve"" or ""hover""
* The values of status are in lower case ""inactive"", ""current""..., Complexity values ""high"",... are correct.
* Scrollbar on the right of the list.

The text search field right of the ""Edit columns"" must hide all rows that do not match. 
An element (row) matches, if either the name, the description text or a value in another column contains the value of the search text.
Leading or trailing whitespace of the search text is ignored.
Case is ignored.

The elements filtered out should disappear with a (preliminary) animation, implemented with ng-animate and a CSS transition.
The number part must change into the form ""15 of 49 Information Systems"". 

When a search text is active, there should be a (preliminary) icon right of the search text box, for example a ""X"" or similar, that clears the search text and restores the full list. 

Note that this view is structurally identical for all types of elements (Technical Components, Projects, Business Processes, ...), but in the scope of this ticket only Information Systems are required.

Note that in addition to filtering by simple text matching there are ""structured filters"" of the form ""status = current"", but this is in another ticket."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	31/Jul/14 9:39 AM	18/Aug/14 4:16 PM														"07/Aug/14 5:38 PM;sepr;rough estimate 2 PD without search

todo wfr split off search story part into a new ticket
clarification search only displayed cols."	"18/Aug/14 4:16 PM;wfr;OK, with noted from the demo meeting:

The text filtering functions should have been split off in to another ticket.
I (Wolfgang) forgot to do so.
Sergii will create another ticket and copy the text from this one."
