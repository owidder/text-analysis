Edit IS name in-place in NC diagram (on inner box)	"To the existing nesting cluster diagram for information systems, add direct in-place editing of the element name.

0) initially, the system shows a NCD with IS as inner elements.
1) the user *double* clicks the box of the element
2) the system shows the name in a edit field. The edit field is ""over"" the box, hiding it partially. The name in the edit field is the complete name, not broken into lines.
3) the user edits the name and leaves the field, for example with a tab or a click outside of the edit field.
4) the system validates the name and displays a message. The validiation rules are the same as when editing the name in the single item view or in the list view.
5) if valid, the system writes the edited name back to the server.

edit field on click position is OK. edit field does not need to be exactly relative to inner box."

The user should be able to leave the editing mode immediately.

If the server is not available, the client should silently fail (for the demo).

We will think later of an indication for ""this element is not yet saved,.. and now it is ok, or now it has failed, retrying..."" But not now."
