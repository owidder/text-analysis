Line charts cause an error message in the Dashboard.	"Line charts cause an error message in the Dashboard.
The line graphs are generated correctly.
The problem lies in the iteratecFunctions.js.
The function 'onSvgGraphicLoaded' is always looking for the ID ""svg2"". But line graphs have no id, because they are generated differently than the other charts.
