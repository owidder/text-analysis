Move iturm source and build into iteraplan project	"Move the first part of the iturm project into the main iteraplan project.
Unify the first part of the project (that is the source and the build up to the exploded war) with the second part of the project that is a subfolder (including an extra build.xml) in iteraplan.

(description before repurposing of the issue)
sry:
I would strongly suggest to move the classes {{IteraplanLdapUserDetailsMapper}} and {{IteraplanLdapUserDetails}} to the Spring Security Extensions project. While you're at it, please do also move the class {{AjaxAwareLoginUrlAuthenticationEntryPoint}}

In addition, allow configuring the name of the LDAP attribute which contains the email address. Currently it is hardcoded as {{mail}}, and I'm afraid not every directory conforms to this expectation. Nevertheless, let mail be the default value, and leave it optional to override.

Please do also update other customization sets which rely on LDAP access!
