Color Scheme	"The client must use a consistent color scheme.
It should be based on the currently fashionable colors as in:
* Windows Modern,  see comment below
* flat colors: http://flatuicolors.com/
* Android default colors
* iteratec color scheme: see attachment
* existing iterplan color scheme

The colors must
* be modern, fresh, flat
* indicate that iteraplan is by iteratec.

The colors might look like the flat colors, but with more magenta,
or like iteraplan, but a bit more colorful.

The color scheme must define colors for two purposes:
* contextual colors in Bootstrap
* simply for giving elements different colors, without a fixed semantics.

Bootstrap contextual colors are: primary, muted,error, warning, info, success, active and so on.
See http://getbootstrap.com/css/  section Helper classes, Contextual colors

In addition, the color scheme must provide 8 colors to give elements in a diagram a background color.
These colors must not be the same as the contextual colors.

The least important requirment ist that we use the existing iteraplan colors.

Process for the scope of this ticket: prepare three variants, present to product owner, internal discussion in Munich, then decision.
