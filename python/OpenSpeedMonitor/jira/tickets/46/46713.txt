Slashes in iteraQl queries in REST-URLs don't work with Tomcat	"A REST-Request, which includes slashes in the iteraQl-Expression, will lead to a 404 error page or an empty page.

Example:
/iteraplan/api/data/InformationSystem[count(/businessMappings/product)=0]

Escaping the slashes won't work:
/iteraplan/api/data/InformationSystem[count(%2FbusinessMappings%2Fproduct)=0]

This happens due to Tomcat behaviour. When the Tomcat system property ""org.apache.tomcat.util.buf.UDecoder.ALLOW_ENCODED_SLASH"" is set to ""true"", then it will work with escaped slashes, but this is a security risk.

May even backslash (to be verified, if this works).	"03/Jul/14 10:37 AM;gph;+Workaround+:
It works, when the slash (respectively the %) is ""double"" encoded. The escaped slash ""%2F"" must be written as ""%252F""

+For example+:
{code}/iteraplan/api/data/InformationSystem[count(/businessMappings/product)=0]{code}

should be written as:
{code}/iteraplan/api/data/InformationSystem[count(%252FbusinessMappings%252Fproduct)=0]{code}

or fully escaped:
{code}/iteraplan/api/data/InformationSystem%5Bcount%28%252FbusinessMappings%252Fproduct%29%3D0%5D{code}
