Create Test Specification for the new REST API	Create Test Specification for the new REST API	46121	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	14/Oct/13 5:30 PM	24/Oct/13 11:05 AM														"17/Oct/13 6:53 PM;lba;While testing up to TC2 i found one issue where the expected behaviour differs from the actual behaviour:

GET /api/metamodel with header field format=xls

Expected behaviour response code 400
Actual behaviour response code 200 and json as response
"	18/Oct/13 2:57 PM;sfe;Created issue for Lars's observation -> ITERAPLAN-2034	"18/Oct/13 2:59 PM;sfe;Localization of metamodel resource seems to be only available in parts, see also test results in ITERAPLAN-2032.
Issue lies with the elastic, or rather the MetamodelExport, not the REST API itself."	18/Oct/13 3:03 PM;sfe;Some response codes are different than mentioned in test spec (see also test result in ITERAPLAN-2032): 400 instead of 404, 404 instead of 401 etc. maybe test spec error?	"18/Oct/13 3:10 PM;sfe;* Test spec does not contain case for using a filtered type in /api/data/<query> requests.
* Test spec does not contain case for checking whether links returned as part of a json response are correct"	"21/Oct/13 11:52 AM;svo;As noted in ITERAPLAN-2034, the ""format"" header field should rather be the ""Accept"" header field, which is part of Http. API is implemented to support this header and not the ""format"" header.
Other headers do not have any influence on the result."	23/Oct/13 10:58 AM;sfe;Everything fine, but behavior for import/export still needs to be clarified.	"24/Oct/13 11:05 AM;sfe;The question whether or not import permission is needed in addition to REST permission to perform the REST import will be answered in ITERAPLAN-2046.
The current implementation does not need the import permission.
The test spec assumes otherwise.

I don't see a need to alter the test specification at this point, but once ITERAPLAN-2046 is decided, it should be corrected if necessary."
