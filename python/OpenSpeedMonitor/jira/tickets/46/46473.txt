Changing enum attribute values doesn't work properly for IE9, IE10 and IE11	"Reproduce:
Open a building block element (for example InformationSystem) and try to change an enum attribute value in IE9 or IE10. After saving, the value will still be the same.

The error doesn't occur, when IE is running in IE8 Document Mode.
IE 8 and other browsers like Firefox or Chrome are not affected.

Workaround:
Configure IE8 Document Mode in Internet Explorer 9/10 or use another browser."		Bug	iteraplan PO	18/Feb/14 2:28 PM	24/Feb/14 11:25 AM					attribute	gui								21/Feb/14 2:41 PM;sfe;@Tester: Please test with several browsers, not only different IEs.	"24/Feb/14 11:25 AM;isc;Tests OK!
