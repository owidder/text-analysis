Deletion of information flow using import not possible	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_
# Log into iteraplan as system
# Download Excel data from Mass Data -> Export/Import
# Delete a row in the InformationFlow sheet (with value in the businessObject column)
# Import the changed file with ""overwrite"" strategy

_Expected:_ After the import, the business object assigned to the deleted information flow was removed from the interface related to that information flow.

_Actual:_ Technical Error Page in step 5 of the import, see also attached error report.

In addition to fixing this issue, please also verify the behavior when an InformationFlow row with negative ID and without assigned business object was removed from the Excel file instead.
To get an appropriate Excel File for this, remove all business objects from an information system interface in iteraplan, and then, after elasticMI has updated, download Excel Data from Mass Data -> Export/Import."

But while handling this ticket, a new issues has occurred. See ITERAPLAN-2585.

Second misbehavior (Remove Information Flow with negative id) hasn't been verified yet. "	"03/Jul/14 11:17 AM;dop;If rows with negative ID's have been deleted and the excel file gets imported, in step 4 wrong information are shown. For example:

{noformat}
Durch den Importvorgang werden folgende Änderungen vorgenommen:
Informationssysteme geändert: 35
Schnittstellen geändert: 46
InformationFlow gelöscht: 46
{noformat}

But in the last step (writing the data), nothing will be changed. I'd suggest to create an improvement ticket for this misbehavior. "
