Migration from 3.1 to 3.2 fails if there are duplicate relations between ISR and BF in the BM and HIST_BM tables	"As, in iteraplan 3.1, there is no unique constraint in the database tables BM and HIST_BM for relations between Information System Releases and Business Functions, some customers seem to have duplicate entries there.

The migration to iteraplan 3.2 moves the relation between Information System Releases and Business Functions into a separate table (+ history table), where a unique constraint is present.
This results in the migration script failing if the customer's data is corrupted with above mentioned duplicates.

Create a script to remove such duplicates before running the migration script."		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Mar/14 4:02 PM	27/Mar/14 11:25 AM					migration									"26/Mar/14 4:08 PM;sfe;Created an oracle version of the clean-up script.
