Fluent in-place editing	"The user must be able to edit model elements in a fluent way.
He can view elements in lists or as single elements, and edit them without saving. The system must accept the edit without blocking, and gives feedback asynchronously, for example a message about a (domain logic) constraint violation. The user can undo an edit, and possibly redo it.

Which features of the Fluent Edit are implemented in the prototype, which are demonstrated as a mock, and which are left out completely, see the tickets."		Epic	iteraplan PO	09/Jul/14 2:51 PM	30/Dec/15 12:06 PM
