Excel Import ignoring create operation for element of type Isr2BoAssociation, Tcr2IeAssociation and InformationFlow	"For users who are not iteraplan_Supervisor but have all rights, no Information Flows, Isr2BoAssociation and Tcr2IeAssoiciations are imported.

*Reproducing of the problem*
* Login with a user who has all rights but is not iteraplan_Supervisor
* Export a full model as Excel file
* add a new Tce2IeAssociation into the excel file and save it
* import the excel file
* after the dry run / validate data you get the following message
“Ignoring a create operation for element of type Tcr2IeAssociation due to missing create permission for the current user.”

*behavior expected*
With full rights, the import of Tcr2IeAssociation and InformationFlow is possible.

@Ingo: Prime Directive: Elastic should mimic the classic side.
What are the cases on the classic side?

@Michael: Please fill the matrix.

@Both

For two given building block types A and B and an association A2B, the permission on A2B must be determined from the permissions on A and B.
There is no way to set the permission on A2B directly opn the classic side.

For each BBT A and B, a user may have either no permission, read, update, create or delete, in ascending implication order.

There are 25 combinations.

Obvious cases and rules:
* no permissions on both BBTs => no permission on association
* full permissions (delete) on both BBTs => full permission (delete) on association
* symmetric: the combination of perm1 on A and perm2 an B  and the symmetrical combination perm2 on A and permission 1 on B result in the same permission on the association.
* monotonous: a higher permission on one type leads to at least the same or a higher permission on the association.

Business mapping is different, because it has 4 ends and explicit permissions.
In this sense it is more like a regular BBT w.r.t. permissions, and less like an association."	"11/Jun/14 8:47 AM;isc;The cases on the classic side is the following:

The import of Isr2BoAssociation, Tcr2IeAssociation and InformationFlows should work the same as on the classic side."
