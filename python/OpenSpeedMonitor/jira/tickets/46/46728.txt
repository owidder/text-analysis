Fresh user interface base 	"The system must have a fresh and modern user interface.
As a base for concrete use cases, the client needs a modern screen layout, modern colors, navigation (menu bar and buttons), and views for the home screen, lists of elements, views of elements.

The look and feel of the UI must be consistent.
It must be possible to show a complete path from the start (login, home) to the use cases. The navigation must implement this path. 
Most other features and their screens can be mocked.
The navigation should implement a few other paths to give the impression of a wider implementation.

The UI must use Twitter Bootstrap for Layout and CSS.
All modifications (colors, sizes, layout, ...) must be done by a Twitter Bootstrap theme.
