Changes of ENUM attribute don't get saved reliably	"Workflow (tested with an IS):
1. click edit 
2. change an enumeration attribute to a different value
3. click save

Result:
New selection only gets saved occasionally.

More details:
The POST request doesn't contain the corresponding line, i.e. componentModel.attributeModel.atgParts[7].atParts[0].avIdToSet=12449
It isn't empty, it simply doesn't exist.

The reasons seems to be, that the hidden HMTL-select is not updated along with the visible dropdown (see image 1)

This issue could be reproduced with IE 9, not with Chrome 33.
