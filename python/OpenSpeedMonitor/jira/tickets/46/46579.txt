reload model after changes via REST API have been merged to db to ensure an up-to-date model	"Ask SFE for the idea, how to change the already happening reload so that it will affect the model read too.

WAS:
Example with iteraplan and external system:

Case 1: ES creates a building block and works on it.

es creates IS1
es updates IS1 at property P1

as is: update OK, because the micro import process loads a new model before processing the update.


Case 2: ES creates a building block and reads it.

work-around 1: wait long enough for reload to happen

work-around 2: ES remembers what it created. 

tidy but expensive: trigger an immediate and synchronous update

economical, but complex: es triggers reload with a request parameter, or suppress reload.

not quite RESTful: add reload as an explicit operation (that is a POST on some new resource

over-engineering: control reloading by global parameter, overrride by request parameter, and offer a reload-POST, and add the ""try again with reload"" URI in every ""not found"" reply on a read/GET.
