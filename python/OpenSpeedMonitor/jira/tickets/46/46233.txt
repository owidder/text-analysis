It is not possible to save building blocks with number attribute values which are "out of bounds"	"Reproducer (with sample data):
# Open arbitrary business process and edit
# Change value of ""Strategic value"" to 50 -> validation error displayed
# Click save => nothing happens (not even an error message)
# Change value of ""Strategic value"" to something between 1 and 10 -> validation error vanishes
# Click save => save works

What should happen:
Saving should work in step 3, too. The number attribute value which is ""out of bounds"" should then be displayed in red."		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/Oct/13 2:34 PM	19/Jan/16 11:30 AM					number	validation								25/Jun/14 2:51 PM;fka;Expected behaviour needs to be clarified	"25/Jun/14 3:09 PM;sfe;In step 3 of the reproducer, Instead of nothing happening, the building block should be saved successfully. Attribute values ""out of bounds"" should then be displayed in red.
In the example above, the value for ""Strategic value"" is outside the bounds 1-10. It should still have been saved, with the attribute value ""50"" then being displayed in red in the building block detail view.

If this explanation is not clear enough, please specifically name the part which needs to be clarified further."
