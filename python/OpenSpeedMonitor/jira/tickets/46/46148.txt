Execute and document tests for existing test-specifications and different setups	"With ITERAPLAN-1990 a selection of test-specifications is created for the following selected topic:
* REST
* Nesting Cluster
* Custom Dashboards
* Import/Export
* History
* Neighbourhood Diagram

Each of these test-specifications should be executed against each of the following, selected setups:
* iteraplan EE / WinXP / IE8 / mssql / default language: german
* iteraplan EE / Win7 / IE9 / oracle / default language: english
* iteraplan EE / Win7 / FF24 / mysql / default language: german  
* iteraplan CE / Win7 / IE9 / hsql / default language: english

Please test with restricted user rights if possible (e.g. with standard-user ""joe""). Please document all results in dedicated copies of the respective test-specification-excel-files (status of test-cases / comments if needed).

Please create a subticket for each constellation of test-specification and setup. Please attach Testresult-Excel-files to the respective subticket. 

If during a test an issue is identified, please create a dedicated issue ticket for it and create a link between the tickets."

The only exception, history in EE with mssql, has to be postponed until the history-migration-script is finalized (see Ticket ITERAPLAN-2100). With regards to version 3.2, this super-ticket can still be closed. The remaining test will be finalized with the missing prerequisites.
