Import does not set last modification info - relationship changes	"This is the same issue that was fixed for property changes in ITERAPLAN-2547.
It was assumed the issue doesn't affect relationship changes, which proved wrong according to my tests.

_Reproduce (with sample data):_
# iteraplan -> Mass Data -> Export/Import
# Download Excel data
# Modify Excel file, adding a relation between ISD ""Remote sys."" and IS ""DSS""
# Import (Strategy doesn't matter)

_Expected:_ New relationship between ""Remote sys."" and ""DSS"" added and last modification time/user for both elements updated.

_Actual:_ Relationship was added, but last modification info was not updated for at least one of the two building blocks."

Failure of {{TypeVariableTest}} is unrelated to this issue."
