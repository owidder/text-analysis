Refactor relationship Informationsystems and Business Functions to a simple direct relation and make it visible on the BF end	"Currently you are offered related business functions for information systems over dialog but not vice versa. However, the relationship should be traceable in both directions. 

Additionally, the current implementation for showing related business functions for information systems is too complex. Therefore, first, the implementation of this direction should be improved / made more efficient. Afterwards the second direction should be enabled."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	26/Aug/13 9:28 AM	22/Oct/13 6:24 PM					consistency	refactoring	relation	usability						04/Sep/13 3:12 PM;lba;While testing the issue ITERAPLAN-1915 was found. This issue is not related to this ticket.	"05/Sep/13 4:36 PM;sfe;Did you test the export/import with your changes?
I've just tried to import an excel file from a customer into the current trunk version and it resulted in an ""Unapplicable Metamodel Change"", apperently trying to ""add informationSystems to BusinessFunction"".
Possibly one of either the metamodel loader in iteraplan or the metamodel importer for the excel import weren't updated?"	06/Sep/13 1:13 PM;sry;Please remove the method {{BusinessFunctionService#getFunctionsForInformationSystemRelease(ISR)}} from the interface and change all callers to work on the ISR object directly. The implementation for that interface method should also be deleted.	"18/Sep/13 2:10 PM;sfe;Notifications and History are not working yet for changes made to assigned Information Systems of a Business Function (see {{HistoryBBChangeset}} and related classes/functionality).
The relation to Information systems also is not available for Business Function bulk updates."	18/Sep/13 4:07 PM;sfe;seems fine	23/Sep/13 4:01 PM;sry;Work fine, many thanks!	22/Oct/13 5:38 PM;sry;A newer Findbugs version found one more problem due to copy-and-paste. Will fix it shortly.
