Define recommendations for thread and connection pool parameters	"For various installation setups, define recommendations for Tomcat's ""max(Spare)Threads"" and DBCP's ""maxActive/maxIdle"" parameters in iteraplan.

Background: ITERAPLAN-1727

Because configuration of thread/ connection pool behavior has an effect on all installed webapps (iteraplan and others), we should be able to give a recommendation.

Possible setups are:
1,) single instance of iteraplan
2.) single instance of iteraplan and other webapp(s)
3.) multiple instances of iteraplan
4.) multiple instances of iteraplan and other webapp(s)

The recommendation should be included in the iteraplan Installation Guide."		Task	iteraplan PO	16/Sep/13 3:41 PM	30/Dec/15 3:19 PM					configuration	performance
