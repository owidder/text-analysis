Pressing Enter in overview page filter forms leads to unexpected results	"On a building block overview page (e.g. for IS), the default tab above the result table is _Full-text search_. If you enter a search-term into the query box, pressing the Enter key causes the form to be submitted and the expected results are shown.

However, that does not work on the second tab _Query_. If you select e.g. property _Name_ and enter some search text into the free-text query field, pressing the Enter key _does not invoke the Search button_ next to it. Instead, still the full-text search is triggered, taking into account whatever value has been entered (or not) on that tab.
If no search text was entered on the full-text search tab, it will always return ""0 results"", regardless of the Query criterion entered on the second tab.

Expected behaviour: 
As a user, I can enter query words for full-text search or for query criteria and press Enter. Then the browser should trigger the search functionality for that tab that I have actually viewed in that moment."
