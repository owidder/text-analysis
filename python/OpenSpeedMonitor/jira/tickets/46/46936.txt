Edit description	"To the existing single item view of IS, add editing of the description text.

Behavior as in previous tickets on edit.

Use a text area as input component.

No validation, all characters are valid, empty description is valid, too.

An empty description should have a placeholder text like ""no description"" in the single item view, so there is already something to click on to start editing."
