Further context visualization	"Whenever a specific, existing Information System is displayed, there should be a selection entry called ""context visualization"" in tab ""visualizations"". 

Selecting this new feature should open a pre-configured svg-diagram with following properties:

* The actual information system whose page the user currently views is a centered, named node
* All information systems, that have at least one direct relationship (meaning interface) to the centralized information system are positioned as named nodes in a circle around it (always connected by a single edge). The information systems are selected according to the following criteria:
** if the ""central"" IS is of type current only current IS are displayed
** if the ""central"" IS is of type planned only planned and current IS are displayed
** if the ""central"" IS is of type target only target and planned and current IS are displayed
** if the ""central"" IS is of type inactive only inactive and current IS are displayed
* The edges are simple lines with no captions
* All displayed Information Systems are colored depending on their status. Colors are predefined and do not have to be configurable for this diagram. A simple color legend is shown.
* To support longer names in a usable way, all node names are shown only in a dedicated legend. The nodes themselves carry referencing arbitrary, distinct numbers (not necessarily same numbers over multiple page requests)
* The diagram kann be downloaded in ""JPG"", ""PNG"", ""PDF"", ""SVG"" and ""MS Visio"" format
* Saving the diagram query within iteraplan is not required
* Edges are not shown with directions, cardinality or other annotations
* Zooming and/or scrolling of the iteraplan-based diagram is not required
* Additional nodes (e.g. with transitive relationships to the centralized information system) should not be shown on the diagram
* Additional edges (e.g. between displayed information systems within the node circle) should not be shown on the diagram
"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	22/Aug/13 6:56 PM	30/Sep/13 11:50 AM														"24/Sep/13 11:16 AM;lba;Things to Test:
 - Check if the colors and the Type of Status of the connected Information Systems are correct
 - Check if Visio and SVG look the same
 - Check if Visio Neighborhood Diagram is compatible to Version 2003, 2007, 2010
 - Check if the Information Systems are correctly aranged in a circle around the selected IS, also check limit cases (0,1,2 - connected IS)
 - Check if the Diagram grows when more IS are connected to one IS
"	"27/Sep/13 10:52 AM;lba;The name of the new context visualization has been decided:

 -  English: Neighborhood Diagram
 - German: Nachbarschafts-Grafik"	"27/Sep/13 2:38 PM;lba;??In Chrome, a tooltip is displayed to the graphic, if one is with the mouse over the graphic. But the tooltip is wrong. It does not work.??
It does work, but only if the graphic is big enough, to not be fully displayed in the frame. The tooltip also appears in every other context visualization, and also exists in version 3.1 of iteraplan, thus it is not part of this ticket to solve this problem.

"	30/Sep/13 11:50 AM;isc;Test was OK	"30/Sep/13 6:01 PM;psc;I performed some further tests, particularly regarding:
* different output format
* circle symmetry
* text shortcuts
* links
* text centering in rectangles
* language support
* caption
* general output design of different blocks (diagram, legends, ...)
* correct neighbors and coloring
* different border case scenarios in terms of connectivity
* IE, FF

The feature works as expected. 
Some remarks:
* In IE SVGs cannot be displayed inline so far according to Steffen. Therefore - by default - in IE a PNG is displayed instead. PNGs however don't support links. This point should be adressed as soon as possible, but cannot be part of this ticket.
* The current implementation of the neighbor diagram does not support links in visio. So far, only information flow diagrams do. This point will be discussed with demand management. In case that it is regarded essentially important, we will open a dedicated follow-up ticket for this change, since linking was not explicitly part of the original specified requirement."	30/Sep/13 6:03 PM;psc;Ticket will be closed.
