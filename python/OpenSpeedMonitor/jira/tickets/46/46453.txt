Attribute import can't read 3.3 Excel format	"See {{VirtualAttributeTypeCreator#createVirtualAttributeTypeFromDefinition(String)}}.
For example for number attributes, in the iteraplan 3.3 Excel format the suffix ""decimal"" is written in the attribute definition of line 4 on the Excel sheet.

The VirtualAttributeTypeCreator expects the suffix ""BigDecimal"" as in the old format.

To reproduce with bankdata:
1. Export iteraplan data to Excel (doesn't matter whether xls or xlsx)
2. Delete Attribute ""Costs"" from iteraplan
3. Import Excel file with checked ""Include Metamodel changes"" checkbox

=> the ""Costs"" attribute in the Excel sheet is not recognized as to be added."
