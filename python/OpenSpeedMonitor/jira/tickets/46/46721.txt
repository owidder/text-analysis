Errors in imported Excel should lead to informative messages.	"If the user edits an exported Excel workbook and re-imports it,
iteraplan should give informative messages (warnings or errors).
It must not ignore the problem silently, nor must it display a technical error only (even if the stacktrace shows the problem clearly).

Several cases found so far, all together in this ticket.
Split off single tickets from this one if analysis shows that the fix is independent of the other cases.

Case 1: Invalid ID ""AA"" (or special charactes ""~!#"") leads to ""name not unique"" in step 4
expected: ""invalid ID: AA"" or similar in step 1.
Tested with fresh export, edit ID of first row of FD, re-import

Case 2: Invalid name "":"" leads to multiple messages ""Missing or invalid value for relationship end businessDomains."" or similar rel. end name.
expected: one single message
tested with FD and IS

Case 3: Empty name leads to technical error with IllegalArgumentException: multiplicity of values to be checked for domain equivalence must be exactly one""
expected: message, but no technical error
tested with IS and FD

Case 4: Invalid accountability value leads to DataIntegrityViolationException => BatchUpdateException: Duplicate entry ... for key 'ID_AV'
expected: warning or error, but no technical error
tested with FD

Case 5: invalid value in position is silently ignored
tested with ""AA"" and ""###"" in FD and GP
expeced: warning (to be discussed, silent ignore could be OK, too)

Case 6: Invalid date value (format) leads to technical error with underlying NumberFormatException
Tested with PROD and development start
Expected warning

Case 7: Invalid date value (ordering) silently ignrored
Tested with PORD and development start after development end.
Expected warning

Case 8: Invalid value for enumeration leads to technical error with underlying MySQLIntegrityConstraintViolationException: Duplicate entry ' ... for key 'NAME'
expected: warning
tested with IS complexity ""other""

Case 9: Invalid status silently ignored
expected warning
tested with IS status ""AWESOME""

Case 10: Invalid direction of interface leads to no warning messages in steps 1 to 4, but to message ""2 changes"" in step 5.
expected warning in step 1, ignored afterwards
tested with IF, direction ""OUTSIDE IN""
