Sporadically occurring changes at Excel roundtrip	"Sometimes after exporting and re-importing an XLSX file, changes are shown in the dry-run step (different types and numbers). This will not happen every time, and sometimes it can be hard to reproduce, but this behavior DID occur. Maybe it is more likely after a server restart and/or with Oracle (12?) database, but I could not find a rule how to reproduce it steadily.
