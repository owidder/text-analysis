Color legend	"Add a color legend to the nesting cluster diagram.

The color legend is an extra panel on the bottom right corner of the diagram.

For the initial coloring with two of the five colors of the architecture domains, 
the legend has two items: 
* box with the icon and color of the outer element type, and with the name of the outer element type
* box with icon, color and name for the inner element type

Note that the text in the box is the type name, not a name of a single element of that type.
Examples: ""Information System"", ""Business Object"" 

The boxes are stacked, box for outer above the box for inner. 

When the inner boxes have a color according to an attribute, for example Complexity, the legend has 
* the box for the outer element as before
* the box for the inner element with icon and type name, but without text
* a one-column table of colored fields with a title above the table: Complexity with rectangles with
** value as text
** background color of the value

The rectangles have no border line, as usual, and no spacing.
The color table is to the right of the outer/inner box group of the legend.

The color legends for other attibutes is similar, for example for Status with four rectangles.
