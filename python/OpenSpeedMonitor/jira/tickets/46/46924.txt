Enable clipping in Landscape diagram (SVG)	Enable clipping in Landscape diagram for output format SVG. 	46784	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	04/Sep/14 3:13 PM	26/Sep/14 11:06 AM														"26/Sep/14 11:06 AM;sfe;Two things I've noticed:
* Texts on both top and side axes are not affected by the clipping setting. When too long, the texts are shortened with a reference to the according names legend entry.
* When disabling clipping AND text shrinking, texts in content elements can overflow despite activated names legend

After discussion with [~wfr], it was decided that these points are acceptable as of now."
