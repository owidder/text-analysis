Bar Chart Diagram should support empty content selection	The Bar Chart Diagram should support generation with an empty set of Building Blocks. Currently, a Business Exception is thrown when generating with an empty selection. As a result, a Custom Dashboard whose filter returns empty set and whose template contains a Bar Chart Diagram contains an error message instead of the emptyBar Chart Diagram (the rest of the Custom Dashboard is rendered correctly).

Please look at the attached screenshot. If no results are provided, the bar chart is "empty". In my opinion, it's useful to display the "no building blocks available message", as implemented in Ticket ITERAPLAN-2603 for Cluster chart.
