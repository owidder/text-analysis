Splash Screen	"When the user navigates his browser to the start URL, the system shows a splash screen in front of the actual start view.
The splash screen fades out after 2 seconds, or if the user clicks it.

The splash screen must use the diagram from the current start screen, see attachment. Note that the attachment is only a rough screenshot.

Text on the splash screen:
iteraplan - IT landscaping now even simpler and more effective

The layout and design of the splash screen may be a bit more ""artful"" than the usual sober UI style."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	09/Jul/14 3:25 PM	30/Dec/15 12:00 PM														"30/Dec/15 12:00 PM;fka;done via loading screen
