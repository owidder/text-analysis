Download as PDF	"Add a global action to the menu bar ""Download as PDF"".

If the user clicks the action, the browser downloads the current diagram to a PDF file. The user interaction is the same as for a SVG file, but the file content is converted to PDF first.

For a conversion to PDF
* extract the SVG as text or as DOM subtree
* convert it to PDF text with a library
* base64 encode the PDF text
* put it into a data URI
