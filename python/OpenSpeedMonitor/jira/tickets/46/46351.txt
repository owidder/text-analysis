Page refresh in landscape diagram configuration leads to discarded input	After selecting comlumn or row mapping in the landscape diagram configuration iteraplan refreshes the page. Fast users not knowing this may lose their input after the refresh. Therefore iteraplan should better display the "reload process" or lock the page during this time to prevent users from entering further configuration details.
