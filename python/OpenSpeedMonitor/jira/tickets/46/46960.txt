Json Micro import erroneously deletes property value(s) when the property is not included in the imported Json	"Expected behaviour:
When a Json for a single building block element is imported via PUT-Request (with default CUD strategy), and a property is not contained in that Json, then the import must ignore this property.

Observed behaviour:
When a property in the Json is missing/removed completely (not only the value), then the (MicroJson)Import deletes the property value (""not assigned"").

For example, remove this from an IS element's Json:
{code}
      ""Complexity"": [
        ""high""
      ],
{code}

Todo:
The import must not delete property values, when the property is not included in the imported Json!
