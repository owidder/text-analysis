Improve the display of the landscape diagram	"Texts in Landscape diagram are partly hard to read. Scope of this ticket is to improve the readability of landscape diagrams. 

*Possible Solutions:*
* Use existing space in boxes efficiently (cf. attached screenshot ""PR"" with poor readability - based on https://iteraplan.iteratec.de/iteraplan_nightly_build/show/graphicalreporting/../fastexport/generateSavedQuery.do?id=17&savedQueryType=reports_export_graphical_Landscape&outputMode=attachment)
* Implement a word wrap, if the text is too long to fit in one box.
* Use other symbols for displaying the processes, because in the current symbols (value chain) isn't enough space
* Adjustable font sizes for axis and content description
