Date format and decimal separater in open building block views are not updated on language change	"_Reproduce:_
# Log into iteraplan and set language to English if it isn't already.
# Open an arbitrary information system with at least one date attribute set
# Change language to german

_Expected:_ Date format changes from MM/dd/yyyy to dd.MM.yyyy
_Actual:_ Displayed date format doesn't change
(Same happens to decimal separators in number attributes)

_Reason:_
When opening a building block, its attribute values are transformed into texts and stored in component models for display.
When changing language, no new transformation is done, instead the text values are reused, now with the wrong format.

_possible Solutions:_
# Store the attribute values as Date or BigDecimal respectively and transform to Texts only on access. Problem in edit masks, as entered texts would be parsed to Date or Number values directly, and if the entered value is invalid, error handling wouldn't work in its current form (wrong/technical error messages, inability to cancel the edit modus). These issues would need to be solved.
# Disable language selection during edit mode. This doesn't fix the wrong formatting after changing language in read mode, but does avoid the issues with editing building blocks after changing the language in edit mode."
