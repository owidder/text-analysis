Information Flow Diagram: No edges displayed if interfaces are not filtered (default)	"After choosing the information systems for the information flow diagram the ""Relevant Interfaces"" tab in step 2 doesn't show any interfaces to display.

""The selection is empty. At least one element or value has to be selected in order to generate the diagram. Please click on 'Filter' to change the selection.""

The generated visualization therefore displays no edges (as all interfaces get filtered). Setting an empty filter returns all interfaces and the vis is fine!

Is related to ITERAPLAN-2252"		Bug	iteraplan PO	08/Nov/13 4:36 PM	09/Jan/14 12:34 PM					visualization									"18/Dec/13 3:18 PM;sfe;I found two remaining issues:

1. JSP error when sending filter query:
* Navigate to Information Flow Diagram page
* Click ""Send query & use results""
* On configuration page 2, click ""Filter Interfaces"" in the ""Relevant Interfaces"" accordion
* On the filter page, click ""Send Query"", *NOT* ""Send query & use results""
This results in a technical error due to a property not found in the memory bean despite being referenced by the JSP.

2. Empty Interfaces selection after saving the query
* Navigate to Information Flow Diagram page
* Click ""Send query & use results""
* On configuration page two, do *NOT* filter interfaces
* If you create the diagram now, all interfaces are displayed
* Now save the query under an arbitrary name
* After saving, the interfaces selection is now empty, and creating the diagram does not show interfaces anymore
* After loading the diagram again, all interfaces are selected and displayed when the diagram is generated.

Both cases also apply to business object filtering."	20/Dec/13 10:04 AM;bra;current solution is to execute the interfaces and businessobjects queries upfront. This however causes issues with permissions (see ITERAPLAN-2252)	"03/Jan/14 11:18 AM;sfe;The issues I've commented on above are fixed now.
There is, however, another thing I've noticed: When filtering interfaces or business objects, then switching back to step 1 (maybe to adjust the information system filter/the selected elements) then going back to step 2 of the diagram again, the interfaces and business object filters are reset.
In my opinion, the configured filters should remain in this case, since other configuration settings on page 2 remain as well."	08/Jan/14 6:08 PM;lba;It Works!	09/Jan/14 3:30 PM;fka;Reviewed, various diagrams generated
