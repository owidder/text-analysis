Attempt to create new attribute via Excel Import leads to error page	"Steps to reproduce (with iteraplan sample data):
1. Log into iteraplan
2. Go to MassData -> Import/Export
3. Export Excel Data
4. Go to Administration -> Attributes
5. Delete attribute ""System Size""
6. Go to MassData -> Import/Export again
7. Attempt to import the previously exported file
=> Error page in Step 3 of the import when trying to apply the metamodel changes (adding of attribute ""System Size"")"		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Aug/13 2:20 PM	01/Jul/14 12:54 PM					attribute	excel								25/Jun/14 3:27 PM;fka;Is this still applicable?	"27/Jun/14 10:31 AM;dop;No it isn't. I've just tried to reproduce this issue and executed the steps described above. The attribute ""System size"" wasn't existent in the bank data example, so I have deleted the attribute ""Complexity"". As expected, import progress succeeded. In step 2 the following messages appeared:

{noformat}
There are changes to the current Metamodel necessary to proceed:
Create Enumeration Attribute Complexity.
Assign attribute type Complexity to building block type Information System.
Assign attribute type Complexity to building block type Interface.
Add literal high to enumeration attribute type Complexity.
Add literal low to enumeration attribute type Complexity.
Add literal average to enumeration attribute type Complexity.
{noformat}

Step 3: 

{noformat}
Following changes were applied to the current Metamodel:
Create Enumeration Attribute Complexity.
Assign attribute type Complexity to building block type Information System.
Assign attribute type Complexity to building block type Interface.
Add literal high to enumeration attribute type Complexity.
Add literal low to enumeration attribute type Complexity.
Add literal average to enumeration attribute type Complexity.
{noformat}

Step 4:

{noformat}
When importing, following changes will be applied:
Information Systems changed: 44
Interfaces changed: 45
{noformat}

Step 5:

{noformat}
Following changes were applied:
Information Systems changed: 44
Interfaces changed: 45
{noformat}


The color of the enum literals got lost during this process. The color of all enum literals is now the same (green). 

@Reviewer: Please decide if it is worthy to create a new improvement ticket to assign different color to newly created enum literals during excel import process. "	01/Jul/14 12:54 PM;sfe;Issue most likely vanished with new import implementation.
