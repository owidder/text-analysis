Icon in box for type	"Add icons to the boxes of the nesting cluster diagram according to the type of the element.

The icon is in the top left corner, left of the title.

The icons are the same as in the tiles for the recent views in the home page.
The icons in the tiles are probably larger, the icons in the NCD are smaller. The height of the icon is the same as the title text, so that the layout of the box does not change vertically.

The icons have the color of the architecture domain, that is red for IS,  yellow for BO, and so on.

The nested inner boxes (if displayed) do _not_ have an icon, to save space.

Note that this is not an option, but an addition to the layout.
So there is no interaction in this ticket, nor new menu entries."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	20/Aug/14 1:11 PM	29/Sep/14 10:12 AM														21/Aug/14 11:11 AM;sepr;Rought est. 1 PD because needs some research on adding icons to SVG rect	"21/Aug/14 8:46 PM;wfr;To add an image in SVG:

* use the image element
* encode the icon file with a online tool, for example http://www.base64-image.de/
* put the text in the href attribute of the image element
* group image and text in a <g> element

So for an icon that is used in HTML and in SVG, there are two artefacts in the client: one as a PNG file, and one as an entry of text in a global, hard coded icon list.

The following example is from a SVG diagram generated by the existing iteraplan application.

"	02/Sep/14 12:13 PM;sepr;We will make icons in white color as text labels instead required "architecture domain"-colored icons in a reason, that background of tiles are "architecture domain"-colored by default and icons in the same color will coincide. Please approve this realization or propose enother solution.	03/Sep/14 4:02 PM;fka;Having the icons in white is a good idea. Should we decide to change it later there will be a new ticket.
