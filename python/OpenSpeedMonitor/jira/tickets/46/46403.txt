Information Flow Diagram: Visio does not show interfaces (arrows, desc)	Visualizing an information flow diagram to Visio, visio does not show the interfaces (arrows, descriptions). This should be corrected.		Bug	iteraplan PO	19/Dec/13 3:30 PM	19/Aug/14 10:55 AM														18/Aug/14 10:42 PM;fka;Client reported issue still not fixed with version 3.3	19/Aug/14 10:49 AM;dop;I have generated several information flow diagrams and at first I had the same issue. But after changing the security settings about macros in Visio (2010), the edges will be displayed. I have changed the security setting to allow all kind of macros (which is not recommended by the application). You can also activate macros, that have a digital signature. There is an step-by-step guide in the userguide (http://www.iteraplan.de/wiki/display/iteraplan/FAQs) which describes how to do that (section: Why are no connectors shown in an information flow diagram (Visio format)?)	"01/Dec/14 11:19 PM;laird;In 3.2 there's a bug that unless you manually filter the interface list, no interfaces are included in the diagram.

This is separate from the certificate/security issue related to macro's."
