Font-color used in Nesting Cluster should change with color of respective clusters	Sometimes - when using dark cluster colours - the text on the cluster cannot be read anymore, since the font-color is black by default. It would be an improvement for those cases, if the font-color could be set automatically relative to the cluster colour.
