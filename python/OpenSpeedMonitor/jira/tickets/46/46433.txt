Upgrade JAWR to version 3.5 and clean up resource bundle definitions	"With version 3.5 of JAWR released, an upgrade will get rid of the JAWR-specific ThreadLocal warn messages popping up in the tomcat log.

The migration doesn't seem to be very complex:
* new dependencies in pom.xml
* two additional configuration lines in jawr.properties to make DWR integration work

Additionally this opportunity should be used to clean up the resource bundle definitions in our jawr.properties file.
It's hard to read and there are more bundles generated than necessary."		Task	iteraplan PO	27/Jan/14 4:13 PM	16/Apr/14 10:28 AM					jawr	library								28/Jan/14 10:45 AM;sfe;see also https://jawr.java.net/	15/Apr/14 10:13 AM;sfe;found a minor bug with icons	"16/Apr/14 10:28 AM;gph;ITERAPLAN-2307
