Landscape diagram with empty element set should leads to an empty diagram	"*Scenario:*
* A Landscape diagram configuration is saved with a certain result set, like for example: InformationSystems that start with ""A"".
* The link to this diagram is provided to other people, who bookmark this link.
* In the meantime, all InformationSystems starting with ""A"" are deleted.
* When the diagram link is used, nothing happens (you get no chart and no error).

*Expected behavior:*
Show an empty diagram as with the cluster diagram.
