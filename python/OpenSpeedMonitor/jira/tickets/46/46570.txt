Small design issues on the import page	"Steffen R. report the following issues to the support:

On the Import Page (Mass Data > Export/Import) the PopUp to the Import Strategies contains the information that there are three strategies, but there are only two.

Furthermore, Steffen proposes to rename the German title of the PopUp into “Import-Strategien”.
The last point, he has reported is that a click on the label ""Include Metamodel changes"", in addition to the selection of import strategies, is not working.

The value of the ""for"" on the <label> not fit to the ID of the checkbox <input>."		Bug	iteraplan PO	09/Apr/14 6:59 AM	29/Apr/14 9:53 AM					gui	import
