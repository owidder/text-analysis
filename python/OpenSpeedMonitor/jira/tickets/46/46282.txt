Clean up unused web resources	"Over the years a couple of images, CSS files etc. have accumulated below the WebContent directory, but some of them aren't used/ referenced any longer. Those should be removed, because they are not maintained and may create confusion.

One notable example are the two files {{WebContent/images/modelGerman.png}} and {{WebContent/images/modelEnglish.png}}. (NOTE: At least the german version is referenced by one of the customization sets, even though the diagram is outdated. It should be moved into the customization.)
