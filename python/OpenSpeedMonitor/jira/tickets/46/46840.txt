Color by status, complexity (discrete)	"Add an interaction for both the inner and outer boxes to set a background color according to a discrete value, for now for the two properties complexity and status. 

Sequence of events:

(0) System shows NCD with inner and outer boxes in initial coloring, according to the color of the architecture domain (red, yellow, blue, ...)
(1) User clicks on an inner box (showing an IS)
(2) System shows context menu with a group with two items:
* show complexity as color
* show status as color

This group is new in this ticket.
The system should show the other items for sorting, too.

(3) User clicks ""show complexity as color""
(4) System changes the color of all inner boxes, according to the complexity of each item, with this fixed color mapping:
* low: green
* average: yellow
* high: red

The colors green, yellow, red are _not_ the same colors as the architecture domain.

The change of the colors should be a short transition.


Variant for status:

(3) User clicks ""show status as color""
(4) System changes color according to:
* planned: blue
* current: green
* target: yellow
* inactive: red
* TBD WFr check default colors?


Variant to clear coloring

(0) System displays a NCD with coloring by complexity
(2) System displays in context menu group:
* static colors
* show status as color

Same for coloring by status with entry to change to coloring by complexity.
The entry to go back to static coloring by architecture domain color is always on top.


Fine design for colors to be done with Tanya, later. Keep colors in one place in code so that we can change them later.

Note that the context menu should work on both outer and inner boxes, but for the moment only if they have a status or complexity attribute.
The outer element  (ISD or BO) may or may not have a status or a complexity property.
