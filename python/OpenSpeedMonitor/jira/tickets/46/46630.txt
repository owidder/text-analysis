Implement diagram creation	"open to detailed design: test with data from the database, or with a model provider independent of the hibernate side and the model bridge?

included: unit and component tests
not included: integration in UI, Selenium tests

open for analysis: how much SVG template is useful?"	46567	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	07/May/14 3:52 PM	07/Jul/14 1:24 PM														"27/Jun/14 9:44 AM;dop;Following issues have been detected while review:

# ContextOverviewWorker.java: remove comment method if not needed
# InfoContainer.java: the name is too general, please use a more specific name if this class is only used for context overview diagrams
# ExportServiceImpl.java: change the name of the method ""generateContextOverviewDiagram"" to ""generateSvgContextOverviewDiagram"" to match the naming scheme 
# ContextOverviewCreator.java: is it useful to include the base64 coded image string in source code? Wouldn't be a link to a resource file better?
# ContextOverviewDiagram.java: 
#* Split long methods to smaller ones. There is much redundant code e.g. in method createListPart()
#* How do did you calculate the X and Y offset? Is there any algorithm. Please document this methods, how to get to these values. It would be more maintainable if you could calculate these values dynamically.
#* There's a method called getStringFromDocument. You have commented this method, that this could will be only used in testing environment. Wouldn't it be useful, to move this code to a testclass?


In General:

# Document public methods
# Use fluent interface for Builder (MetaModel, Model). Please discuss with [~wfr] first. 
# use /** */ to comment classes and methods instead of //
# All the offsets are static. Does it work it this way? Or do you have to scale these values dependent on the size of the diagramm?
# Are the methods for creating a Test Metamodel and Model at its right place or does it belong to test source code folder?
# Added some new tests"	"01/Jul/14 3:55 PM;dop;Furthermore:

# implement linebreak for long BB names (e.g. COD for Clearing Inland -> Interfaces)
# the font of the BB is not the same as in other diagrams
# delete the configure button
