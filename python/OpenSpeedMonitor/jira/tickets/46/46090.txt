Import: changing the parent of a building block can cause data corruption	"Example:
Business Processes A, A1 and A2; A is parent of A1 and A2 which are ordered A1, A2 in the children list.

Import resetting parent of A1 so A1 moves to hierarchical top level causes the children list of A to be corrupted.

A cannot be displayed on the UI anymore, an error screen appears instead."		Bug	iteraplan PO	26/Sep/13 10:31 AM	08/Oct/13 11:12 AM					hierarchy	Import	position							26/Sep/13 10:41 AM;sfe;As in ITERAPLAN-1306 mentioned, an import as described above causes the POS values in the database to be inconsistent. As such the database can be repaired with the already existing repair_pos_column SQL scripts.	27/Sep/13 1:02 PM;sfe;This happens whether you move the element to top level or to another place. As long as you use the import to change the parent of an element which previously has siblings after its own position, this error will appear.	"30/Sep/13 9:19 AM;sfe;The issue here is that the {{DiffBuilder}}, due to the ""additive import mode"", does not create a diff for the removal of A1 from the children list of A.
That means when the building blocks are saved, A1 both does not have a parent, but is child of A. This seems to be somewhat resolved correctly, except that the POS-value of A2 does not get adjusted to the removal of A1, since it never was explicitely removed."	01/Oct/13 8:51 AM;sfe;One special import constellation still causes problems: Changing of the parent of an element (to another parent, not to "null") when the original parent is not listed in the import file.	"07/Oct/13 9:12 AM;sfe;Documentation change at https://www.iteraplan.de/wiki/display/upcomingIteraplan/How+to+use+Import+and+Export:
In chapter *""Additive nature"" of the Import* the passage about updating *to-one relationships* was changed to reflect current behavior."	07/Oct/13 11:23 AM;sfe;Still need to add feedback to the user in the case of a relation change not being applied because the previously assigned element was not part of the imported file.	08/Oct/13 11:12 AM;kgo;All is well.	"11/Oct/13 7:03 PM;psc;Reviewed. I checked the described scenario.
Afterwards, I now could still open the parent element and its child list was correct. 
Ticket will be closed."
