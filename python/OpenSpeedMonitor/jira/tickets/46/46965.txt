Move inner box one step left/right or first/last	"To the existing nesting cluster diagram, add a way to rearrange the inner boxes.

(0) The user clicks an inner box.
(1) The system shows (among others) in a context menu the actions 
* move left
* move right
* move to start
* move to end
The system shows only the actions that are possible. Impossible actions are hidden (not deactivated).
(2) The user selects an action.
(3) The system moves the box to the target position and shifts the other boxes as needed.

Note that this command must work both for boxes in outer boxes, and nested inner boxes in (base) inner boxes."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	17/Sep/14 4:57 PM	29/Sep/14 10:44 AM														18/Sep/14 9:43 AM;sepr;Est 2 PD
