Linebreak for all element labels	"* all diagram types
* content element and axes
* all output formats (svg, visio)

Shapes and label have a given width

A) one line break should be done if text is wider than the shape. Two line breaks if text is wider than twice the shape width. 

B) Try 0,1, 2 ,3 ,.. linebreaks, then take the layout width with maximal font size and minimal linebreaks

B is simple generalization of A, same effort but better result"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	16/May/14 9:26 AM	19/Jan/16 11:08 AM
