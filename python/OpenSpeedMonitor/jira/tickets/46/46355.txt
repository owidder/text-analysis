Information systems in Visio information flow diagrams are placed on top of each other	Using Visio information flow diagrams requires manual layouting effort. This is because the IS elements are placed on top of each other and need to be "replaced" manually. The IS elemts are on the same hierarchy level. Changing the layout option (Standard, KK-Force, Circle) has no positive effect.
