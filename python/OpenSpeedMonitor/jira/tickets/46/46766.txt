Get Model from REST API	"Write an angular service that 
* reads the full model with GET<...>/data) from a local iteraplan server
* parses the JSON response into a (big) JS object

Write a unit test that checks if the model contains the expected number of elements for each building block type (for example IS, ISD, TC, IE ...).
Get the expected numbers from the old iteraplan web UI.

Write an angular service that returns only the information systems in the model. This service must use the first service for the full model.

Add unit test for that service.

Measure the time for reading the full model and discuss with Wolfgang.

For UI, trigger the reading at client startup.
After the reading is finished, show a simple popup message with the statistics as simple text in the form ""Model reading OK: 28 AD, 43 BP, BU""...419 total.""

The message should fade after 2 seconds."
