Clarify and implement LMT cross check on connect	"When importing an external representation of a model (currently in Excel),
that leads to the connection of two building blocks,
the import must not overwrite changes 
that have been made after the export (and before the current import).

For a property change in a given buiding block, only the current LMT of the internal model and the export timestamp must be compared.

For a connect of two building blocks, both LMT timestamps must be before the export timestamp.

Step 1: verify the statement above with DM and/or a senior consultant.

Step 2: if required, add this check to a filter

Step 3: if step 2 proves difficult, enhance difference structure so that LMT of both connected building blocks are readily accessible
If so, dissuss this decision with WFr briefly.
