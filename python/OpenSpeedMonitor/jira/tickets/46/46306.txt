Analysis and improvement of IE10 support	"Currently, iteraplan enforces IE9-Compatibility-Mode when opened in IE10. This is a workaround, since js-modals apparently are not working as expected in IE10 without this compatibility mode.

Please perform the following steps:
* Analyse the issue with modal windows in IE10
* Analyse and document further known differences between IE9 and IE10 that might affect iteraplan / Check and document systematically, that no further issues (apart from the one with modals) occurs if the compatibility mode is deactivated
* Fix the issue with modals as well as any further issue identified for IE10 in the course of the analysis phase
* Finally, make sure that the compatibility mode is no longer automatically set when using IE10 and disable the currently established IE10-warning on the iteraplan mainpage."
