Relations: No Lexicographical Ordering on Building Block Details Page	"In the _Relations_ tab of a building block's details page the lists of associated building blocks are not ordered. If the number of relations exceeds a certain amount this becomes confusing. 

E.g., in an unordered list of 200 Business Units as part of a Business Domain it is very hard to find the one you want to delete."
