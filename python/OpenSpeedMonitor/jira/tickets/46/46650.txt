Remember last tab and tree/list view	"1. In the element detail view: Per user and per building block type:
Save which tab has been chosen by the user (by clicking on it in the GUI). Do this for view and create modus. This saved setting will affect the default tab in a newly opened detail element view and create new element view, but not already open elements which might be reloaded.
Persist this in the database so that it is used when the user logs in again. Remembered state is nowhere shown and there is no way to set or reset it.

User who logs in for the first time will be shown the default tab.

2. Implement the same for tree / list view. Remember if tree / list view has been chosen, not more. Same behaviour as with 1.

3. The default tab for the element detail view should always be ""Attributed"".
