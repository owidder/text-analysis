Cleanup orphaned named queries in Hibernate mapping files	"Some of the predefined Hibernate(Template)/HQL named queries in the *.hbm.xml mapping files may not be referenced any longer in the code.

Find these orphaned queries and check (with caution), if query names are constructed in another way, so that a fulltext search can't find them. Maybe mark those queries as ""DEPRECATED"" in a first step, if it is not sure. In a second step, these queries can be removed.
