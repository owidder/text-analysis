Using the browser's "Back" button after clicking on the filter of a Nesting Cluster Graphic caues query framework error	"To reproduce, execute the following steps:
- create a new Nesting Cluster Graphic, and select ""Information Systems"" as inner element.
- click on the filter button of the inner box
- try to return to the nesting cluster graphic page using the browser's back button or backspace (not the ""back"" button displayed on the website, this works!)

Instead of the NCG configuration page, you will get an error stating:
""The requested operation depends on the query framework, which is either disabled or unavailable in your version of iteraplan.""

This error message will prevail even after reloading the page or navigating back to it from other pages. 
Clearing the session or executing the reset context action on NCG will fix this problem."		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/Oct/13 1:47 PM	30/Dec/15 4:54 PM					cluster	nesting
