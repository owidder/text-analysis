Enable configuration of nesting cluster with parent/child-hierarchy but without specified inner element	"Having selected a type for the outer element during setup of a nesting cluster diagram, a dropdown is enabled so that a type of self-relationship (e.g. parent, children) can be selected. 

However, currently, there is no way to generate the diagram from there without making a further choice regarding the inner element. You can choose the id attribute for the inner element as a workaround to create a diagram with the hierarchy of interest, but you cannot avoid the inner elements beeing shown as part of the diagram. 

There should be a possibility to generate nesting cluster diagrams that are dedicated to self-relationships between elements of a single (outer) element type."
