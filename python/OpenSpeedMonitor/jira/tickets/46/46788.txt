Skeleton with all screens and major technologies	"Create a skeleton for the application.

The skeleton has all four screens (home, list, list of IS, single item IS, nesting cluster)

The skeleton uses all major technologies:
* angular
* bootstrap
* ng-route
* JSON
* JS unit test

The skeleton demonstrates also the use of SVN and the (very simple) deployment on a developer's computer.

Out of scope:
* real visual design
* real functions and interactions
* real server access"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	05/Aug/14 9:25 AM	18/Aug/14 4:13 PM														"18/Aug/14 4:13 PM;wfr;OK
