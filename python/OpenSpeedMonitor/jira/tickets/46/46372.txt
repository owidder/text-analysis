iteraplan does not ensure unique names for Information Systems	"I have an information system named ""app42"" with the release 1.0 (making the full name app42 # 1.0) and a successor with the same name and release 2.0 (app42 # 2.0).
When I delete the release from app42 # 1.0 and from app42 # 2.0, there are two different information systems with the exact same name (app42). When I try to change the name from one of those afterwards, the change also occur in the other information system."		Bug	iteraplan PO	03/Dec/13 8:04 AM	01/Jul/14 12:56 PM														"05/Dec/13 8:37 AM;wfr;Suggestion:
- reproduce UI actions 
- close this ticket as invalid
- create a ticket for a UI improvement ""clarify the structure of base and release BB _visually_"".
 

Analysis only (that is: not reproduced).

The user observes the correct behavior (correct meaning as specified),
but his interpretation is different, based on a different mental metamodel.

The initial situation is actually
- 2 ISRs (app42#1.0, app42#2.0)
- 1 IS (app42). 
But the user sees this as two different ISs.

After deleting the releases, there still is only one IS, not two.
This IS has a unique name.
Changing this name in one view (as IS of the deleted ISR 1.0) is visible from the other view (IS of ISR 2.0) as well."	05/Dec/13 11:05 AM;LHM-User;When releases are deleted afterwards, iteraplan interprets both views as two information systems with the same name. For example, when I try to import data via Excel file, iteraplan responds with an error message that indicates that there are two information systems with the name "app42".	25/Jun/14 2:15 PM;fka;Is this still applicable?	"27/Jun/14 11:14 AM;dop;Seems to be fixed. I have created two ISR (1.0 and 2.0) and wanted to delete the release. iteraplan says:
