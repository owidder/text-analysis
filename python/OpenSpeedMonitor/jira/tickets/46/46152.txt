Consistent handling of the deletion of queries in the Custom Dashboards	"In the current implementation of the Custom Dashboards, a dashboard depends on a numer of previously configured and saved elements. In particular, the dashboard is an instance of a dashboard template. Furthermore, a dashboard instance depends on exactly one saved spreadsheet report, and a dashboard template may depend on a number of saved graphical reports. As a consequence of this dependency, the deletion of the base elements may have different effects. Several scenarios can be identified and expose the following behaviour:

 * Deletion of a saved graphical report, referenced by a dashboard template: The saved query is deleted without nofifying the user that dashboards depend on it. Conseqent renderings of the dashboard replace the diagram which should have been produced by the saved query with an inline error message, stating that a saved graphical report is missing.
 * Deletion of a dashboard tempalte, referenced by one or more dashboards: The template is not deleted and an error message is reported to the user, stating that the template is used in at least one dashboard.
 * Deletion of a saved spreadsheet report referenced by a dashboard: The saved spreadsheet report is not removed and an error message is reported to the user, stating that the saved spreadsheet report is referenced in at least one dashboard.

It would be better if iteraplan beahves consistently in all three cases, i.e. if the deletion of saved graphical reports is also blocked when they are referenced in a dashboard."
