Wrong name validation of interfaces when importing partial Excel data	"_Reproduce with sample data:_
# iteraplan -> Mass Data -> Export/Import
# Check ""partial"" checkbox and Information System from the select list
# Download Data
# Import the file without changes. Import strategy shouldn't matter

_Expected:_ Import with no changes

_Actual:_ Validation error messages about interfaces with two '#' characters in their names.

_Why?_
IteraplanNameValidator excludes Interfaces from the name validation by checking the persistent name of the structured type to validate.
But in partial exports, the persistent names of the types are different from complete metamodels.

_Solution:_
Check against the persistent name of the canonic base type."		Bug	iteraplan PO	22/Jul/14 1:40 PM	23/Jul/14 2:29 PM					import	interfaces	validation
