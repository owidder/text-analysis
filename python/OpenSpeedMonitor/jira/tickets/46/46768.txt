Iteraplan Import crash when XLSX has multiple errors (name-field not filled)	"When I try to import the attached XLSX file I get an  general error instead of a proper error message.

{quote}A general technical error occurred. To continue, please click Close or Cancel, or clear the current session.{quote}

The mistake in the file is that the mandatory ""name"" field is not filled for multiple records, but some of the optional attributes are filled.

This error occurs also in version 3.3.1 (but wasn't able to select)"		Bug	iteraplan PO	28/Jul/14 2:43 PM	04/Aug/14 2:55 PM
