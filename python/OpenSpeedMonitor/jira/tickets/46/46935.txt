Edit status and state of health	"To the existing single item view of an IS, add editing of the properties status and state of health as a dropdown box. The modified IS is modified locally (visible in other views as list and diagram), and written back to the REST API (and visible there in the traditional iteraplan UI).

Steps:
(0) initial: system shows value as text.
(1) user clicks value.
(2) system shows dropdown box instead of text.
(3) user selects new value (or not). New value could be ""no value"" for state of health, but not for status.
(4) user clicks outside, or ""tabs"" the focus away
(5) system shows modified value  as text again
(6) system writes back modified IS asynchronously

Note that for a selection of 1 out of n values, there is no validation required.
If the value is optional, the list has an extra ""no value"" entry.
If the value is required, the list does not have such an entry.
So every possible selection is also valid.
