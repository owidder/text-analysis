Master plan levels 2-3 should be filtered to plan's date range	"A master plan has a date range. The master plan should only display elements that are productive during that date range. Currently all level 2-3 elements are displayed, leading to visualizations that are filled with blank rows.

For example, see attached master plan. It runs from 12/2013 to 12/2014, but contains numerous projects completed in 2011 and 2012 and earlier in 2013 that aren't relevant or useful."
