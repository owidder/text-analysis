Move Spring Security Extentions into iteraplan svn	"Move the spring security extensions project to the iteraplan svn and adjust related jenkins jobs.
Add it as one of the ""iteraplan helpers"" to https://iteraplan.iteratec.de/svn/iteraplan-helper

Close down the SSE project on sourceforge with a friendly goodbye message.

##########
_old:_
Move the spring security extensions into the main iteraplan source tree (maybe into a new source folder, or in an existing one) and replace in iturm the library dependency with the jar file from the enclosing iteraplan project.

Note that an ""upward"" dependency on a product of an enclosing project is a bit of a workaround, but far cleaner than ""build locally, copy war, commit"".

After that, the SSE is no longer depended on as a separate project and/or JAR.
