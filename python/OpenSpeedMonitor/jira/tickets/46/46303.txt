Documentation: Revision of the structure of the Installation Guide	"The structure of the Installation Guide is very unstructured.
Some contents do not fit to the structure under which they depend.
The aim should be to see the Red Thread, from the installation prerequisites over the installation and the configuration.

How the structure should look ultimately, is to be discussed in detail.
