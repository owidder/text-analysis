Cardinality Constraing Violation in german localization is missing information	"English example:
{{Cardinality constraint violation: ""[attribute type]"" of [building block type] ""[name]"" has not been set, but needs a value assigned.}}

German:
{{Verletzung der Kardinalit√§tsbegrenzung: ""[attribute type]"" von ""[building block type]"" hat keinen Wert zugewiesen.}}

As you can see, the name of the offending building block type is missing.
The resource file should be fixed so the german message matches the english one."		Bug	iteraplan PO	08/Jul/14 11:31 AM	10/Jul/14 9:42 AM
