The Check for uniqueness of names is not constant.	"I tried to import an excel sheet where I have added 4 Architecturel Domains with name who are already existis.
In the most cases the plausibility check give an error, but the number of violations varies.
With each import, he finds a different number of violations.

But it can also happen that it finds nothing, so that you get an exception in one of the next import steps.

---
Currently this issue cannot be reproduced as is, since recently the {{UniquenessConstraintValidator}} does not check uniqueness of names anymore. This task is now responsibility of the {{DomainIdentityUniquenessConstraintValidator}}, see also ITERAPLAN-2681.
It was decided to fix the issue nonetheless, to avoid possible future problems with this validator.

The issue can be reproduced according to the original issue description above, when line 95 of {{UniquenessConstraintValidator#validate(Model, MessageListener)}} is changed from
{{if (rProp.isUnique() && !rProp.isDefining()) {}}
to
{{if (rProp.isUnique()) {}}

Alternatively a revision before the {{DomainIdentityUniquenessConstraintValidator}} was introduced can be used for verifying the original issue."		Bug	iteraplan PO	14/Aug/14 1:24 PM	02/Sep/14 3:14 PM
