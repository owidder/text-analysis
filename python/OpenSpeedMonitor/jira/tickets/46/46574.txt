Extra property changes for omitted _predefined_ properties in JSON PUT	"JSON PUT with a minimal OE JSON structure, example:
{code}
{
  ""result"": [
    {
      ""description"": [
        ""My super RESTful proj""
      ]
    }
  ]
}
{code}

Note: name and position missing, both are predefined and not technical.

UpdateDiff contains changes for these properties, to EV.none.
Later (validation?) exception, leading to a 500 response.

Debugging shows: masking for missing fields is called, both for missing predefined and user defined properties, but only user defined properties are successfully masked.

Hypothesis for root cause: quirk in masking and metamodel wrapping.
Maybe problems with equals/hashcode for property expressions? Or different Strings?
