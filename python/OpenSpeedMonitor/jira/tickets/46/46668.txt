Replace previous CSV Export by Netto-List-CSV-Export	"The old csv export should be replaced by the new csv export function, which is used for exporting data from the simple list view. 

But in the current implementation of csv export for spreadsheet reports, the exported list gets enriched by additional information such as internal database ids. This feature should be still usable in the new export function. 

So for the new export function, there must be the ability to add columns for ""Application ID"", ""Release ID"", ""Parent Application ID"", ""Parent Release ID"" in order to export these information as csv.

For improving the usability create a button or any other type of gui element, that enables exporting the ""old"" csv style in one click. After clicking the this button, the four additional columns listed above are added to the simple list view and an export is triggered.

How can we mark these special attributes as special, visually? "	"05/Jun/14 9:50 AM;dop;Currently the following columns are present in the ""old"" csv export:

* *Full name*	
* Application ID	
* Application Name	
* Release ID	
* Release	
* Parent Application ID	
* Parent Application Name	
* Parent Release ID	
* Parent Release	
* *Description*	
* *From*	
* *To*	
* *Status*

The bold attributes are already configurable in the netto list csv export, so only the non-bold attributes must be added to the netto list csv export. Are all of these attributes still relevant? This must be clarified. 
"	10/Jun/14 3:58 PM;dop;Attached two csv files, which show the style of the "old" csv export. 	"11/Jun/14 6:04 PM;wfr;Please use the naming system in ITERAPLAN-2553 as far as possible, and discuss problems.
Note that 2553 has a wider scope than the new columns for information systems, and is not ToDo as of now."	"12/Jun/14 1:30 PM;dop;I updated the user guide which now says, that the previous csv export function is deprecated and how to use the netto list csv export with specific columns instead.
