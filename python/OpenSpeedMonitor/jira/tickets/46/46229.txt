Document metamodel localization special cases	"Localization of our (elastic) metamodel is incomplete. While, for example, the ""last modification"" property has a localized name, ""runtimePeriod"" does not. Relationship end names generally are not localized, either. These things are visible, for example, in Excel files downloaded from the Export/Import page.

The reason for this lies with the Metamodel export of our ""to elastic"" bridge.
In future iteraplan versions, when the elastic core may be replaced with an improved version, this issue will likely be gone.

In the meantime, these peculiarities should be mentioned in the user documentation."		Task	iteraplan PO	25/Oct/13 11:13 AM	19/Jan/16 11:33 AM					documentation	elastic	metamodel
