Meaningless error message during Excel import	"When trying to add data via an Excel import I get this error message: 

{{Missing or invalid value for relationship end informationSystemDomains.}} 

This does not tell me anything beyond that something went wrong, so I have little chances to rectify the situation. 

Some research of my own indicated that something with the data in the Excel sheet I try to import is wrong and I could sort out some issues, but this is very cumbersome. 

What I need would be an error message which points at least to the data record in the Excel sheet where the problem occurred. A description of the actual problem would be very helpful to resolve the issue quickly."

Please have a look at the attached screenshot.

In the top left corner, the information system domain has been renamed from ""External sys."" to ""new name"". In the top right corner you can see the Sheet ISD-IS, which describes the mapping between IS and ISD. Since it's a name based mapping, iteraplan can not found the corresponding ISDs for the top 5 ISRs (Rows 8-12). In Ticket ITERAPLAN-2597, the error message has been extended to show the name of the sheet and the row/cell, which has led to an error. 

I guess this ticket can be closed, because it is realized by  ITERAPLAN-2597"	"14/Jul/14 1:12 PM;dop;The error message has been extended one again:

{noformat}
Error in sheet FD-GP B-8: No Object of type Business Domain with the name ""Cash & Liquidity Mgmt"" found in file.
{noformat}

It should be now more clear to the user. "	"14/Jul/14 1:18 PM;frank.reiter;This is exactly the kind of clarity I was looking for! 

Many thanks!"	14/Jul/14 1:33 PM;sfe;Documentation looks fine.
