Implement Kerberos-based Single Sign On in cooperation with IIS	"The projected setup is, that an IIS installation terminates the HTTP(S) request from a user.
The IIS needs to be configured to perform Windows authentication for the iteraplan URL path. To make that work, the server must be a member of the Windows Active Directory.

iteraplan will then receive the authenticated user name in a specific header from IIS. If that request header is not present, access will be denied. The user name passed from IIS is simply trusted. Based on that user name, the user's roles and permissions are retrieved from LDAP by iteraplan."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	19/Dec/13 4:28 PM	01/Apr/14 4:49 PM					authentication	Kerberos	SSO						Windows Server with IIS and domain membership. iteraplan's Tomcat may run on that same server, but can also be on a separate server. Communication between IIS and Tomcat happens via AJP.	15/Jan/14 9:52 PM;sry;Ready for Test, from my perspective. Still waiting for feedback on test version from customer, though.	18/Mar/14 5:49 PM;sry;Some minor changes for supporting BASIC auth are needed. Will do :)	"18/Mar/14 7:02 PM;sry;HTTP Basic is now supported.

In addition, a small Filter has been added that redirect all requests meant for the login page to the application home page (""/""). This makes it more convenient for users with a bookmark to the homepage. Thanks for feedback from customer!"	01/Apr/14 4:49 PM;gph;Seems to work properly. Documentation looks good.
