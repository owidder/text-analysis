Error handling and logging for XMI import	"Currently the XMI import does not write error log entries within the first import step and also does not show a precise error messsage in the GUI. The error is only desribed as a general ""technical error"".

Therefore it is very difficult and time consuming to find out what causes an import error. 

The error handling and logging should be improved for the XMI import."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	28/Aug/13 12:54 PM	30/Dec/15 3:17 PM					import
