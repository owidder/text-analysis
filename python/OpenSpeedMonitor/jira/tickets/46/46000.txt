Revision of the functional Permissions	"*This is the successor ticket for the ticket* ITERAPLAN-1785

-----

From time to time our customers have problems with the functional permissions.
The following problems are mentioned again and again:

* The names of the functional permissions are not meaningful and sometimes even confusing.
    For example the functional permission ""Ausführen von gespeicherten Abfragen für Grafische Auswertungen"" means the visibility of the menu entry and also the right to execute diagram reports. The name of the permission refers to saved queries and says nothing about whether or not I can create diagrams. I know that saved queries are also diagrams, but in the name of this permission there is a differentiation. This is only one example. There are still some more permissions, where the name is not indicative of the actual authorization. To solve this problem, the names have to be adjusted.
* There is no clear structuring of the permissions. Some permissions include Read, Create, Update, and Delete permissions. Other permissions have been split. In iteraplan the permissions are sorted by name. Thereby the overview is lost.
    Structurally related permissions should be displayed in groups.
    Even better it would be, if the permissions are assigned as for building block types (after CRUT). However, this requires a general revision of permissions.
* For the import and export of XMI files, there are two permissions (""Run export (XMI)"" and ""Run import (XMI)""). For Excel, there is only a permission for import (""Run import (Excel)"") but there is no permission for export.

In general, the permissions should be revised and the permissions should be more transparent."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	15/Aug/13 10:34 AM						permissions	usability
