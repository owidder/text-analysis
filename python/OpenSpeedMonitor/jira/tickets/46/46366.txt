Bar and Pie diagrams don't work with enumeration attribute values with certain special characters	"To reproduce (with sample data):
# Create new enumeration attribute type with two values ""te'st"" and ""test""
# Assign the new attribute to business processes
# Set for the new attribute the value ""te'st"" in at least one business process
# Create pie chart for all business processes
# Configure the new enumeration attribute for coloring
# Set ""attribute values"" (instead of ""Maintenance"") in the select box below the attribute selection
# Create diagram
=> Error page

Obviously, the expected behavior is for the diagram to be created instead.

There is no known workaround, except renaming of enumeration attribute values to not contain the escaped characters, which are:
|\ |(backslash)|
|â€˜|(single quote)|
|[|(square bracket)|
|]|(square bracket)|
|${|(dollar followed by opening curly bracket)|
