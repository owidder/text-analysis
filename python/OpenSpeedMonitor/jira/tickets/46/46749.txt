Design mockup for screen flow	"Create a set of screen mockups that show the basic strucure of the applicaiton and the main screen flow.


Screens (core list):
* Home
* List of Information Systems
* Single Information System
* Nested Cluster Diagram

Story:
* User starts at www.iteraplan.de/iteraplan9
* System shows Home scree
* User clicks item for last view ""Information Systems""
* System shows ""List of IS""
* User clicks first item
* System shows ""Single IS""
* User edits a property
* User goes back.
* System shows List again
* User clicks ""as Nesting Cluster Diagram""
* System shows Diagram
** outer boxes: first 20 items of the list, rest as ""123 more"" extra box
** inner boxes: Technical Components 
** no coloring
* User configures Diagram in a few steps:
** other type for inner boxes: Busines Object
** Filter for outer boxes: only ""status = current"": extra box ""123 more"" disappears
** coloring for outer by state of health
** coloring of innter by another property
** more steps...: sort, drag and drop, highlight a single element
* User clicks Save As PDF
* System downloads as PDF and opens PDF Viewer
* User clicks ""Share""
* System asks for name
* User enters name
* System confirms sharing by a notification message with undo button
* User does notihing, coinfirmation fades out
* ... more steps later, navigation back, but no new screens for that


"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	18/Jul/14 8:43 AM	04/Aug/14 5:34 PM														21/Jul/14 12:52 PM;tala;Sketches for screens	"21/Jul/14 2:16 PM;wfr;on 1 - Home

Overall screen structure is OK.

The start screen of the old iteraplan will be a page of the home screen, but not the ""home page"" of the home screen.
As of now, we have only one page in the home screen, and this page has the recent views of the user as tiles.
In a further step, but not for the first iteration, the home screen will have several pages: recent view, favorite views, meta model (= old start screen), notifications...

Note that the items in the recent views can be lists, single items and diagrams.

Depending on the available width, the messages and alerts may show more text, and the user name may be collapsed.
I think that the last message/alert is more important than my login name, so I would like to see the (beginning of the) message, and only my avatar/picture.

The footer with copyright and version ID is OK. 

The home screen has a view title in the menubar, too: ""Home"". 






"	"21/Jul/14 2:20 PM;wfr;on 2 - Elements as Tiles

We will have a tiles view of a collection of elements, but for now I would like to start with a traditional list view.
The tiles view is used in the recent page of the home screen.

The arrows left and right of the view title are active/clickable. Would you show them as a button? Or are there other ways to show ""active""?

The icon and title combination for the tiles is OK.

The screen does not have a breadcrumbs list. 
The navigation must be so clear, that we do not need a hierachy ""you are here"" sign."	"21/Jul/14 2:22 PM;wfr;on 3 - Single Element View

This is close to the original layout. On the one hand, it is a good thing to start with the existing logic. On the other hand, the existing structure could be simpler and more clear.

We need the title of the element in the main content area (in addition to the title in the menu bar), because we want to click and edit it. We cannot click and edit the element in the menu bar.

The description text may be in slightly smaller print. We will talk about the layout of the header part (name, description, productive from/until, ... ) later.

I want to get rid of the tabs and the boxed collapse/expand groups.
They have way to many border lines.

I would like to have one level of grouping, and a much lighter form of groups.
So instead of ""property in group in tab"", I would like to see:
list of groups, maybe flowing in two to four columns (responsive to width).
A collapsed group is only a single line with the title and a expand button.
A expanded group is a list of properties. Between the last property of a group and the first property of the second group is a bit more white space, but _no_ line, no boxes.

Maybe we can use subtle background colors to make a group appear as a cohesive thing.


 "	"21/Jul/14 2:40 PM;wfr;on 4 list of diagram configurations

The design is that of a ""list of diagram configurations"".

Yes, we will have lists of diagram configurations later.
For now, we have a recently displayed diagram in the recent views view, but not in an extra view.

In a list view, we may have ""infinite"" scrolling, So we display a ""123 more"" in a regular, scrolling list.
We will keep one or two pages to scroll down.

On the other hand, we want to display the total number of entries, and maybe the current position/interval somewhere. 
A fading message after the user stops scrolling?


"	"21/Jul/14 2:51 PM;wfr;on 5 nesting cluster diagram

Here we will have a lot of interaction, selection, drag'n drop and so on.

In this view, I thought of adding a ""123 more"" box in the bottom right corner.

My first thought was of a box with a message,
On the other hand, if we can generate and layout a diagram with two more pages to the right and down, each, we may have ""infinite scrolling"" as in a list of items.
In that case, we will need a ""123 more"" or ""147 elements"" message somewhere, but unobtrusive. 
Maybe showing after scrolling, fading after stopping.
"	"04/Aug/14 5:34 PM;wfr;OK: design for all four basic screens.
Further design will be done in extra tickets.

Ticket was done before the current ticket workflow was configured.
