Highlight box of interest	"Visually highlight one or more boxes, outer, inner or nested inner, by an explicit user action.

Add an item ""Highlight"" to the context menu of the boxes. Add it at the end.

If highlited, the context menu has the item ""Clear highlight"" instead.

For visual highlighting, add a ""iteragenta"" (that special iteratec magenta) border frame.
Do not change the layout, that is the position of the elements by highlighting.

There can be more than one highlighted boxes in the diagram.

Note on development priority within this ticket:
Highlight one is more important than highlight two or more
Highlight inner box is more important than outer box, and that more imporant than nested inner box.

Global action ""Clear all highlights"" in the menu bar"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	20/Aug/14 11:09 AM	29/Sep/14 10:12 AM														21/Aug/14 11:07 AM;sepr;Est. 1 PD
