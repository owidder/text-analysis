Check for duplicate names when creating new entities is case-sensitive in some cases, but is supposed to be case-insensitive	"When creating, for example, a new building block or a new user in iteraplan, a service method to determine whether an entity of the same type with the same name and a different ID already exists is called.
This is to prevent creation of duplicate entities.
This service method uses the method {{GenericBaseDAO#doesObjectWithDifferentIdExist.}}

Please improve the hibernate criteria-restrictions used in that method to make sure the query is case-insensitive, regardless of database character set and collation.

_Possible solution:_
The Restrictions-class of hibernate, already used in the method, offers functionality to do this. But this may cause database indexes to not apply for that query, thus may degrade performance (needs to be looked into some more).

* Please also add javadoc to the method, indicating that the parameter ""identifier"" can be null.
* Also add an SQL script to detect name duplicates like this for all building block tables with names and the users table.
* An automatic fix script renaming duplicate entries is problematic at least for the users table, as the login process might refer to one of the user entities."		Bug	iteraplan PO	10/Jun/14 10:38 AM	17/Jun/14 3:02 PM					case-sensitivity	uniqueness								10/Jun/14 10:40 AM;sfe;As in some cases, for example for users, the creation of duplicates as described in the issue leads to iteraplan not working anymore (due to ElasticMI often requiring case-insensitive uniqueness), the original "task" issue will be closed as duplicate, and this "defect" issue will be the primary one.	"10/Jun/14 2:02 PM;sfe;Another possibility to fix this issue for Oracle DB is to create a logon-trigger in the iteraplan database schema, setting NLS_COMP and NLS_SORT for the session after each logon.
See also: http://forum.spring.io/forum/spring-projects/data/102188-best-way-to-set-nls-sort-for-oracle second post

However, the fix detailed in the issue description, using hibernate query restrictions, is the preferred variant, as it's database independent and the possible performance hit is expected to be very minor."	16/Jun/14 4:06 PM;dop;In the fix for this ticket, there are only two SQL scripts for detecting and altering duplicate names for oracle databases. I have tested all other supported databases (MySQL, MSSQL, HSQLDB) and none of these have had this issue before.
