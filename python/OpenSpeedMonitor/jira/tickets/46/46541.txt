Cluster diagram: saved query corrupt if contained attribute was renamed	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_
# Navigate to iteraplan -> Visualizations -> Cluster Diagram
# Create a new Cluster Diagram for Architectural Domains
# Select attribute ""Accountability"" as one of the active rows
# Save the diagram
# Now rename ""Accountability""
# Go back to the Cluster Diagram page, reset and load the previously saved diagram

_Expected:_
Warning about changed attribute appears and the renamed Accountability attribute is present in the row list of the configuration, under the new name and deselected.

_Actual:_
The warning appears, but the attribute is present, under the new name, *twice* in the row list, both entries unselected. You are also unable to select these entries, thus unable to adjust the saved query to the attribute renaming. The query would have to be created anew.

_Places to look at:_
* {{SavedQueryServiceImpl#checkClusterDiagramAttributeTypeNotNullOrChanged}}
* {{InitFormHelperServiceImpl#initClusterDiagramForm}}
* {{InitFormHelperServiceImpl#setSecondOrderBeansData}}"		Bug	iteraplan PO	27/Mar/14 9:12 AM	28/Aug/14 4:28 PM					attribute	cluster	savedquery
