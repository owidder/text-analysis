Landscape Diagram should support empty content selection	The LandscapeDiagram should support generation with an empty set of Building Blocks. Currently, a Business Exception is thrown when generating with an empty selection. As a result, a Custom Dashboard whose filter returns empty set and whose template contains a Landscape Diagram contains an error message instead of the empty LandscapeDiagram (the rest of the Custom Dashboard is rendered correctly).
