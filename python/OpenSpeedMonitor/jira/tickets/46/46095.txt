Selecting technical components not available for interfaces but are available?	"This is the case:

(1) define technical component and mark it as ""not available for interfaces""
(2) create new interface
(3) open selector for technical components (""Is implemented by the following Technical Components"")
(4) technical component created in (1) appears in list
(5) select technical component from (1)
(6) add some more technical components (randomly, whatever is available)
(7) press save

There will be the following error then:
""The following errors occurred: The chosen Technical Component cannot be used in an Interface.""

Two issues:
(a) why technical components not available for interfaces do appear in selection list?
(b) WHICH technical component cannot be used in an interface? At least show the names of the technical components not suitable so there does not need to be any try-and-error
