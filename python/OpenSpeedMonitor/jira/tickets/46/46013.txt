Enable dashboard templates to handle visualizations of different building block types	"Dashboard templates should be enabled to handle visualizations of different building block types.

Therefore:
* During dashboard template creation it should not be necessary to choose a related building block type
* Dashboard templates should be references rather by a name than by a dedicated related building block type
* When adding diagrams into a dashboard template, every visualization should be available (not just the ones dedicated to related building block type)
* During creation of custom dashboard, 
** first, a dashboard template should be selected
** second, all visualizations in this template should be listed 
** third, one query for each visualization should be determined whilst only those query are made available, that fit the respective vizualization.
Query should be re-usable for different vizualization of the dashboard template.
* Migration-mechanisms should be made available so that existing dashboard can easily be migrated "		New Feature	iteraplan PO	21/Aug/13 6:21 PM	30/Dec/15 3:17 PM
