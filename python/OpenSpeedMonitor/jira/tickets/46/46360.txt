Task	iteraplan PO	22/Nov/13 3:41 PM	09/Dec/13 11:06 AM														22/Nov/13 3:42 PM;psc;See ITERAPLAN-2187 for the respective POC.	"27/Nov/13 4:46 PM;jmi;I decided to exclude ""User Guide"" and ""More"" from testing for now, because these two open in a new window (or tab or other-browser-equivalent) and not only can pop-up-Blockers be a problem but seleniums also assigns random numbers to the window (e.g. ""selenium_blank46404"") and that makes switching windows rather difficult.
(Also testing the ""More""-item would need to connect with the Internet for every test - something I'm not sure should be part of this test at all)"	16/Dec/13 9:48 AM;psc;Ticket will be closed.
