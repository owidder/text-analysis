Additional language packs for download	"The iteraplan default installation should only contain the supported language packs (tested and quality assured). Supported Language packs for iteraplan are only German and English.
Further language packs that are provided by the community are offered as download (exluding support or bug fixes for these packs) on a wiki page of the iteraplan community. 
An installation routine for the additional language packs has to be provided."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	05/Sep/13 6:31 PM	09/Feb/15 9:07 PM					cfnr
