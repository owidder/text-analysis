Global search returns URL too long after editing BBE's business mappings	After editing an IS' business mappings the global search returns URL too long (s. screenshot) E.g., Many business mappings are added to an IS, but IS BBE is not saved itself. After searching for a string in the global search and clicking "search" a page "Request URL too long" appears.
