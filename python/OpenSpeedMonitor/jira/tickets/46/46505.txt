Improve save times for building blocks	"Some customers report times of up to one minute for saving a single building block.
Detailed logs show complicated SQL select queries with a lot of ""joins"" before the database contents are updated with the new information the customer wanted to save.

These select queries are likely necessary for hibernate to perform validation and concurrency handling.
