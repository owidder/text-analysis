Improve insert diagram GUI in custom dashboard templates	"To improve usability:

When a custom dashboard template is created, and the insert button is clicked, then:
* The column with the ""execute/play"" button is misleading.
* The filter text field should have cursor focus.
* The filter text field should be empty before re-opening or after closing.
