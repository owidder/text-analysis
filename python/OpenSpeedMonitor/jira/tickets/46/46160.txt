Dashboard Template allows linking of Attribute Cluster Diagrams	"Currently, a Cluster Diagram for Attributes can be added to a Dashboard Template. While this is generally OK, it may lead to confusion a particular case:
If the selected Attribute is enabled for the Builting Block Type of the Dashboard Template, the Building Blocks of this type will be added to the resulting diagram (in a Custom Dashboard) not in accordance with the Saved Spreadsheet Report used for the Custom Dashboard, but rather with all Building Blocks which have a value set for the selected Attribute.

Note: It should also be documented somewhere that the Saved Spreadsheet Report is used to replace the filter in each Saved Graphical Report, with the exception of Nesing Cluster Diagrams."
