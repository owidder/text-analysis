Import Tests - Testcase 5 #17 fails	"During Execution of the import/export tests in ITERAPLAN-2043, Step#17 of TC 5 fails.
Subject is change of Business Processes and Information Systems without Permissions for Business Processes by excel import.
During the import, the hierarchy of several Business Processes should be changed and a new Information System should be created. 
All permissions for Information Systems are granted, but for Business Processes only read permissions are granted.
The Test expects the Information System to be created successfully and the Business Processes to be updated accordingly.
However, an exception is returned stating that the user does not have sufficient permissions and nothing is updated."		Bug	iteraplan PO	24/Oct/13 4:59 PM	25/Oct/13 3:59 PM
