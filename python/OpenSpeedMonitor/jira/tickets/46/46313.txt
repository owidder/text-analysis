Global search fails at []-brackets	"When searching for a term containing square brackets, iteraplan produces ""invalid syntax"" message:

Your search query has an invalid syntax. Try changing the search string. Example: Cust* would find Customer or customs.
Question mark (?) and asterisk (*) are always treated as wildcards and must appear next to further characters; you cannot search for these two special characters.
Each opening bracket must be matched by a closing bracket.
Following characters have a special meaning and should only be used after careful consideration: + - & | ! ( ) { } [ ] ^ "" ~ * ? : \
Other special characters may get silently ignored or lead to unexpected results.
Please refer to the online documentation for more details."
