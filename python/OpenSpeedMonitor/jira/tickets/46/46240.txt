Import: error page when trying to import changes to building blocks without update permission	"Reproduce (sample data):
# Login with user which has read permission for Business Processes, but no update/create permissions (for example standard user ""Tom"" of role ""IT Architect"")
# Export Excel data
# Change value in ""Strategic value"" of a Business Process
# Import Excel file => step 1-4 ok, Error page in step 5

What should happen:
Errors should not happen in step 5. So either the missing permission error should be reported earlier (step 4, most likely) or no error should appear."
