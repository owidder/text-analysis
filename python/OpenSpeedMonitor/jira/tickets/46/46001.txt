Resetting a search on building block overview pages forces display of the result list to "all displayed on one page"	"Reproduce:
1. Open iteraplan and navigage to, for example, information system overview page
2. Make sure pagination is set to ""20 per page""
3. Click ""Reset and show all""
=> Pagination changes to ""All""

This is a problem particularly for customers with large lists using older browsers (especially IE) since rendering the complete building block list can take very long.
The pagination settings should be kept when resetting the search."
