Extend netto list export with CSV	"The netto list export (available with tabular reports and all building block lists) should be extend to provide output in CSV format. This would be the third option and the last option in the menu. Name it ""CSV"".

Pay attention to escaping:
Multi-line comments
Delimiters in strings
Quotation marks in strings
etc.

The delimiter should be configurable globally in a suitable config file."
