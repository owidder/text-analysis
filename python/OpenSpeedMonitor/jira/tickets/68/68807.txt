Personal Demo (Management) System should do separate deployments instead of multiple data sources	"as is: Personal Demo System creates a new user and a new database / data source



to be: PDS creates a new deployment with a separate database and soew  on:

* deployment on Tomcat

* new license key, with new expiry date

* database

* configuration to use new database

* new user in (singleton/shared) iTurm



simpler than as-is: user can be iteraplan superuser, because she has not to be prevented from changing the datasource. Yeah.



Must be ready for 5.2, because the feature ""multiple data sources"" is removed as part of the  Hibernate upgrade"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	07/Jan/16 9:47 AM	27/Aug/16 11:44 AM
