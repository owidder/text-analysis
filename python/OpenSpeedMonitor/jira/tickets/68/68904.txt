* On filter configuration changes, the displayed URL has to be updated

* On entering a URL with filter configuration, the filter configuration has to be correctly applied

old description:

* -Make the FilterDialog use the new CombinedFilter object- Parts of this have been realized in this ticket. It is possible to create a very simple combinedFilter by means of the dialog. The entire connection between the dialog and the combinedFilter is now part of ITERAPLAN-3933.

* Make DiagramControllers use the new CombinedFilter object"	65407	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	08/Jan/16 10:11 AM	24/Mar/16 11:06 AM														"02/Feb/16 11:21 AM;mbr;Done:

-it is possible to create a simple combined filter via the dialog (filtering informationsSystems by a text filter on related informationSystemDomains). This filter is applied when drawing the diagram and written into the URI.

-Almost all LSD-related tests are working, except for """"should getLegendModel"" in LSD table model builder's test suite. Should be part of ITERAPLAN-4304 (?)



@Reviewer: Please have a close look at the implementation in lsdConfiguration and ask ([~mbr] if necessary"	04/Feb/16 10:03 AM;mbr;-Additional task: make it possible to edit a primaryType filter via the dialog	"24/Mar/16 9:04 AM;abo;Follow-Ups:
