Graphics Reactor can't handle files with space in the filename	"Following does not work for a file which has a space in the filename:

* Upload the file

* Download the file

* Delete the file



Especially the last one is annoying since files created by a transformation with a space in the filename cannot be removed anymore without access to the server."		Bug	iteraplan PO	05/Feb/16 2:25 PM	11/Feb/16 1:07 PM					reactor
