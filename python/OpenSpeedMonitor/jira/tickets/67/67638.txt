Upgrade Commons DBCP to 1.4 and JDBC drivers to JDBC 4 standard	"Upgrade Commons DBCP dependency from 1.3. to 1.4. This is necessary for Hibernate 4 upgrade. More details about the DBCP compatibilities with JDBC and JRE are on this page:

https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp



This page says ""how it works"":

??DBCP 2 compiles and runs under Java 7 only (JDBC 4.1)??

??DBCP 1.4 compiles and runs under Java 6 only (JDBC 4)??

??DBCP 1.3 compiles and runs under Java 1.4-5 only (JDBC 3)??





JDBC drivers like Oracle's ojdbc5.jar and HSQL 1.8.0 support JDBC to version 3. That is ok with DBCP 1.3 (which should be used with JDK 4 and 5).



If a newer version of DBCP is used, like DBCP 1.4 (for JDK 6) or DBCP2 (for JDK 7), then the JDBC drivers have to be JDBC 4 compliant.



Check the used JDBC drivers and upgrade them, if necessary.

* (/) mysql-connector-java-5.1.31 is most likely ok

* (/) MS SQL Server sqljdbc4.jar is most likely ok

* (/) Oracle's ojdbc5.jar should be replaced with ojdbc6.jar

* (/) HSQL 1.8.0 should be upgraded to the latest stable version

** Upgrade HSQLDB installation on build server (x) (see comment)





The drivers are not distributed any longer to the customers, but it should be mentioned in the documentation, which driver versions are required.
