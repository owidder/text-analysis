Add 2-step composite relationship ends over relationship/association types	"Add relationship ends for composite paths that go via a association type (aka relationship type expression type).



First of all, ask someone who knows the ancient Java Elastic: [~sfe], [~wfr], [~gph]



Secondly, note this:



* A type has 3 different kinds of relationship ends:

** direct to a real (node) type, including self relationships

** direct to a association type (not real)

** 2-step via association to real type (more on loops: ask [~wfr] or [~sfe])



* Type has 2 different access methods:

** get all direct relationship ends (this is for basic navigation in the metamodel)

** get all ""perceived as real by user"" relationship ends, ""for display"", ""as in the start screen diagram"", that is direct to real and 2 step as above.



* new class: composite relationship end. Basically represents two relationship ends chained one after another.

** persistent name (non qualified) ""r1/r2"", as in ""businessObjectAssosciations/businessObject""

** new method for translation key: ""Isr2BoAssociation.businessObject"", or ""AssociationType.r2"" 

** add new method for translation key to existing RelEnd class, too



* use new translation key method for all RelEnd translations



* Use this new structure in code that builds the options for the axes of the LSD. Decide if this is an extra ticket.



* Check BusinessObject code if the new composite relationship end could be problematic.
