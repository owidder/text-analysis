iteraQL query for duration not working in english locale	"In iteraQL you can create queries for duration attributes (like InformationSystem@runtimePeriod) using a contains operator.

The value to compare to has to be given in following format: ""fromDate/toDate"".



And here is the issue: ""/"" is used within a date serialization in the english locale already, for example ""07/01/2011"".



Reproduce the error by entering for example following query in the query console of iteraplan with english locale active:

{{InformationSystem\[@runtimePeriod .contains(""05/01/2011/06/01/2011"")\];}}



In german locale it works as follows:

{{InformationSystem\[@runtimePeriod .contains(""01.05.2011/01.06.2011"")\];}}



Fix by using another separator between both dates, for example a semicolon.
