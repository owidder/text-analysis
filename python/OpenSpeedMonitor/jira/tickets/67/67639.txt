"21/Jan/16 4:29 PM;gph;The HSQLDB 2.x has different transactional behavior then 1.8. In 1.8 the default transaction isolation level was READ_UNCOMMITTED. In 2.x there are different transaction control modes like two-phase-lock and MVCC. For example, MVCC supports only the transaction levels SERIALIZABLE and READ_COMMITTED.



In our integration tests, we open a transaction explicitly in ""BaseTransactionalTestSupport.setUp()"" to import the sample data for each test case, but _without_ committing. In the test case itself, service methods are called and Spring AOP transactions are invoked. This leads to a lock in Hibernate ID generation with HSQLDB 2.x. The call stack is hanging forever in HSQL's JDBC driver classes ( latch.await() ).



This could be resolved by committing the transaction with the import statements explicitly in the setUp() method before proceeding with the test cases.
