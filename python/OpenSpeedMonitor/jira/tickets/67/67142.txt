Rename table AT	"""at"" is a reserved keyword in many database systems, which from time to time causes problems (for example: migration with Oracle, upgrading HSQLDB ...).



Solution:

Rename the table in the hibernate mapping(s) and any other referenced locations from ""AT"" to something else.



A migration script should exists as well.
