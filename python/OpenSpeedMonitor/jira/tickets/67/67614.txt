Filter on undefined values lead to error	"*Summary:*

If you filter on an attribute, where the value is not set for some Building Blocks then you get an error.

Reason: createTextPredicate does not work with undefined.



*Reproduce:*

* Open Landscape Diagram

* Set content filter for description = ""a""



*Expected*

* Correct filtering by description = ""a""



*Actual:*

* Error



*Analysis:*

Open createTextPredicate() (line 38) in filterPredicateBuilder.js. If ""item"" is undefined, line item.indexOf returns an error."
