Bug	iteraplan PO	17/Dec/15 1:32 PM	08/Feb/16 4:11 PM					Test									17/Dec/15 5:31 PM;lwi;the problem really was, that a page reload was done during the reactor test. but you could only notice this problem, if this test is NOT on last position of the karma tests. if it was on last position, everything was as usual. i changed the service.reactor.js to not make a page reload. please verify that the file downloading still works. i edited the unit test but now the coverage is not 100% anymore. 	08/Jan/16 4:04 PM;msr;"Upload file" in Reactor does not work in IE 9.	05/Feb/16 11:20 AM;lwi;new ticket for upload file bug: see ITERAPLAN-4344
