Search for the performance bottleneck in page load	"*Summary:*

Check for items loading time after refreshing the mpd page.

*As-Is:*

If too many elements are in the mpd diagram (more than 500), page loads in more than 15 seconds while diagram render takes ~5."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	13/May/16 1:10 PM	04/Jun/16 1:13 PM														"02/Jun/16 12:37 PM;dmkh;After completing performance testing of pipeline run after full page load or refresh we can make next conclusions:

- after implementing new masterplan diagram layout performance improved significantly (now load of 2000 rows takes ~4 seconds for FF and Chrome, ~10 seconds for IE);

- most of the time is taken by diagram draw/redraw, so there is no need to change functionality of mpdDataService.js or mpdItemBuilder.js;

- however, it is desirable to left 500 rows limit, because GoJS scrolling and panning becomes uncomfortable for big generated canvases inside of fixed containers, also synchronization of two diagrams in IE becomes slower and stepped.



So, we have great results now but as for masterplan diagram specifics (fixed containers for diagrams) we have to keep 500 as row limit for better scrolling/panning of diagrams."	"04/Jun/16 1:13 PM;msr;Thank you for your detailed analysis.

Let's keep the limit of 500 rows."
