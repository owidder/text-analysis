Did you get any errors or warning during the migration (e.g. during application of the migration scripts)?



We need more information to reproduce the errors.

Could you please additionally provide the following information for further investigation?

* Authentication method, e.g. iTurm or LDAP or Single-Sign-On

* From the conf-directory of your Tomcat-Installation:

 ** web.xml

* “localhost.log” files from your tomcat installation (just for the period, when the error occurred).

"20/May/16 8:48 AM;sfe;Current status of the analysis is, that in the hibernate search library a configured implementation from within the same jar file is not found.
Why, however, I cannot yet say.
