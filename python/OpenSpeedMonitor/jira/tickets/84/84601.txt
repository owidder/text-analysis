"20/May/16 8:48 AM;sfe;Current status of the analysis is, that in the hibernate search library a configured implementation from within the same jar file is not found.
Why, however, I cannot yet say.

Please upgrade your java version to at least Oracle java 7, according to the new requirements of iteraplan with version 5.2.0."
