Small update in iteraplan-Doku	"Page:

Text-Part:

The individual migration scripts of the according installer can be found within the installer package in the folder ""migration"".



Problem:

In my downloaded iteraplan-5.2.0-basis-installer the folder I can find is called ""upgrade"" and not ""migration"". It is worth to check if the name was not changed over time... and maybe it needs an update."		Fault	iteraplan Support	12/May/16 10:43 AM	18/May/16 9:07 AM														"12/May/16 10:43 AM;ddu;
