Update Documentation for usage of MySQL with iteraplan	"Please check the information below and make necessary adjustments to our documentation:





copied from support ticket:



I feel we need an update on the following page:

https://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan52/MySQL

(or/the same

https://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan53/MySQL



Details:

I just installed MySQL 5.7 (the latest versions) and could notice the following discrapances to the descriptions provided on the iteraplan-docu-page:



Update 1: InnoDB is now the default Storage Engine for MySQL. Therefore there is no need to reconfigure anything. Details are provided here:

https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.7/en/innodb-default-se.html



Update 2: after executing the SQL command ""show variables;"" I was looking for (copy from iteraplan docu) ""The variable storage_engine holds the current database engine"".

Now, in MySQL 5.7, there is no variable ""storage_engine"". The only I could found was the variable ""default_storage_engine"".



My general feeling is that the whole top-part of the page is not really important with MySQL 5.7, as also ""lower_case_table_names=1"" is already set correctly directly after the installation.



NOTE: According to my quick google-search, already from MySQL 5.5.5 the InnoDB is the default Storage Engine"		Task	iteraplan PO	13/May/16 3:08 PM	12/Sep/16 4:33 PM														"30/Aug/16 8:14 AM;cst;https://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan54/MySQL
