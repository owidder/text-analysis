Add numeric column			New Feature	iteraplan PO	10/May/16 11:02 AM	01/Jun/16 2:57 PM														"25/May/16 12:55 PM;mwe;Add button is already implemented.

Check that all numeric values can be added as columns.

The complete rowData will be built when loading the list page. You have to make sure that all possible numeric values are set into the rowData in RowDataBuilder."	"25/May/16 3:17 PM;mwe;Format like in classic client corresponding to locale translation:

* comma-separated (German) and dot-separated (English) values

* With two decimal places"	"31/May/16 2:55 PM;mse;*Review comments*



(I reviewed this ticket together with ITERAPLAN-4576 and ITERAPLAN-4577 as they were closely related and most commits were belonging to several tickets)



* General:

** Could you maybe improve the JSdoc comments? They are not in accordance with the iteraplan guidlines (https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/display/ITPL/JSDoc). This is true for many parts of the new list implementation, of course ;) Maybe you could start with your parts of the code and we can try to cover the rest on the fly.

* utils.js:

** Maybe one could refactor the ""translateNumber"" method in ""utils.js"" by moving the call of ""number.toString()"" out of the ""if (language === 'de')"" statement (lines 94-98).

* ListConfiguration.js:

** There was an ""unsortedIcon = true"" option for all ""this.columnDefs.columnFields"". This was removed at some point. Was that done on purpose?

* utils-spec.js:

** In the 'should return localized numbers' test: Maybe one could use the ""translateNumber"" method for the integer numbers also with the 2 decimal digits option as this is the way the method is called in the client. The expected value should not change nonetheless, I think.

* e2e tests:

** Could you refactor all list e2e tests so that they use the new listPage.goToList() helper method?

** Maybe add some logging messages to all tests so that it is easier to see that they were actually executed (e.g. like ""console.info('Performing test ""basic-IFD-spec.js""');"")
