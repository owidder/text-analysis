Move column (reordering)	"Add a visual hint that the column header is draggable. 

Mouse cursor changes, for example.

Note that the drag source is the full area of the header cell. 



Note that the ""one step left"" and so on buttons are not needed.



Reordering triggers change of column ordering in ListConfiguration. Don't rerender the columnDefs and rowData."
