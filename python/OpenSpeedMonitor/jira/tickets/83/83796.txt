Handling of default dateIntervals	"*Summary:*

Implement a handling of default dateIntervals for all Building Block Types.



*As-Is:*

* The date interval ""runtimePeriod"" is hard-coded in the mpdConfiguration. But this duration attribute does not exist for all Building Block Types. This leads to errors when changing the Building Block Type.



*To-Be:*

* For any Building Block Type there is dynamically the alphabetically first date interval selected.



*Implementation Details:*

* As soon as the user selects another Building Block Type, all duration attributes for this Building Block Type are fetched from the metamodel.

* The alphabetically first duration attribute is selected as duration attribute.

* You can expect, that you get a ""correct"" Building Block Type from the Toolarea which has at least one duration attribute

* Update ""setBuildingBlockType""-method in mpdConfiguration to reset lower levels (e.g. if user selects new level 1, level 2 and level 3 are set to null).



*UI:*

* No UI-elements (no legend, toolarea)
