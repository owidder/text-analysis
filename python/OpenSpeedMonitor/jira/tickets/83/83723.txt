Delete column	"Add delete button and adjust ListConfiguration and build ColumnDefs.

Don't rebuild the rowData."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	10/May/16 11:01 AM	07/Jun/16 11:44 AM														18/May/16 10:59 AM;mwe;Add delete button like in the following link: [https://ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-header-rendering/index.php]	"01/Jun/16 5:11 PM;ach;Review Comments:

* refactor _headerCellRendererFunc_ method:

** outsource click method events into extra methods (make code more readable)

** change _jsdoc_

*** method description = what does this method do

*** params object: add link to ag-grid doc, than you can delete unused fields from jsdoc 

** ensure there is no ""double sorting"". It should be sorted only once, even if delete button were clicked

* disable the ag-grid drag-&-drop deleting feature (drag a column outside the viewport of the grid - it will dissapear)

"	"02/Jun/16 2:57 PM;tsu;I couldn't fix the problem with the ""double sorting"":

* I tried to set the suppressSorting property to true in the delete button eventlistener, but this changed nothing. There was no api function for this either

* I tried to use the event.stopPropagation() Method in the delete button eventlistener, but because of this the grid falls back to the standard sort model.



The ag-grid library had to be updated for the suppressing of the deletion by drag and drop. 

The property suppressDragLeaveHidesColumns in the gridOptions, which is part of the new version solved the problem."
