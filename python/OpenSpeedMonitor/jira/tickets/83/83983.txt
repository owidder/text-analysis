Num-Filter-Slider does not have the preselected values after page refresh	"# Go to ncd diagram.

# Select filter costs and between 1000 and 4000. (the exact numbers are not really important only they should be not 1 and 5000)

# Click Close button

# Refresh page

# Open filter dialog



Expected: The filter costs with between 1000 and 4000 is selected.



Reality: The filter costs with between 1 and 5000 is selected.



Observation: The values are read from the URI correctly and also executed on the diagram. Only the slider is not set properly."
