UI design cleanup	"Adjust layout of list view:



Page header:

* Headline (""Showing..."") smaller

* Filter button on the very left side

* Text filter next to it on the left

* Add column form on the right



List (see also screenschot from ""old new"" list):

* Complete table

** Margin on the left and right

** No 2 scrollbars on the right

** No empty space on the right if not enough columns are shown: one column (default: description) should get the remaining space

* Table header

** Background dark-grey

** Remove drag'n'drop icon

** Column name aligned left (with sorting icon on the very left if sorting is active for this column)

** Delete cutton (""X"") aligned right and always above text

** Column separator between header cells

** Column groups:

*** When there are grouped columns and non-grouped columns at the same time, the top half of the header of non-grouped columns is inactive and doesn't react to clicking and dragging

*** Possible fix: Change the look of the top half of the header (which is a separate div from the bottom half) to blend with the background, so no attempts to click it are made.

*** Mouse pointer changes to drag icon when hovered

* Rows

** No column separators

** Zebra look (alternating white and light-grey background)



Check layout in all browsers!
