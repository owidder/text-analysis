"18/May/16 10:20 AM;abo;URL changed to: http://localhost:8080/client/#/list/InformationSystem?locale=en

(Because of other feature implementations in the meantime)"	"18/May/16 2:08 PM;abo;*Review-Comments:*

* The view's name in the navigation part of the page-header is missing

* Column names are not translated

* Permission-handling not implemented - when I open the URL without view-permissions, I'm redirected to the home screen. Instead an appropriate error message should be shown.

* There should be a link from the home screen, at least for the list of InformationSystems

* in {{ListView.controller.js}} - why use this: {{if(angular.isUndefined(categoryType) || categoryType === null)}} instead of {{if(categoryType)}} ?

* gridOptions ""angularCompileXXX"" in {{list.component.js}} is for performance optimizations, as I know from another meeting with [~mwe] - please add an appropriate comment.

* in {{list.component.js}} it seems a bit odd, that you create a new {{ListConfiguration}} with the datamodel, just to pull it out again a few lines later, aside with a statically defined column-definition."	"23/May/16 4:59 PM;mwe;Comment on Review:

* View's name and page header buttons added

* Column names translated

* If the list cannot be shown because the requested type is not available because of missing permission or typo a modal dialog with the list of building block types will be shown

* The link from the home screen will be added in the following ticket: [ITERAPLAN-4596]

* Why not use if(categoryType)? - See [http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2559318/how-to-check-for-an-undefined-or-null-variable-in-javascript]

* Added comment to gridOptions ""angularCompileXXX""

* Refactored the ListConfiguration and component completely"	23/May/16 5:00 PM;mwe;Please review together with ticket [ITERAPLAN-4563] because there are some overlap.	13/Jun/16 4:15 PM;mwe;Do not consider Commits 3440, 3439, 3438 and 3437.
