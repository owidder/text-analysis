selection	"Add a checkbox to the list item.



Tbd:

* How to remember the checked items if they disappear in the virtual repeat nirvana?

* How should checked and filtered items been handled?

* Check usability of checking the 500th item and the 1000th item. The user has to scroll to the checked items by hand. Is there an easier solution? (Maybe add a list of checked items?)"
