Add relation property column	"Properties of a relationship type which already is displayed in a column.

The properties should be shown in the same order as the related elements.

Sorting should be turned off for this column.

To get the properties you have to resolve the relations with association objects (like Isr2BoAssociation).



Sequence for a new relation property column: 

1) add column with (names of) related elements

2) add column with property for that relation.

Before step 1), the column in step 2) is not avaliable in the list of additional columns.



The new column in step 2) is placed right of its related element (names) column.

Note that the rightmost relationship property column might be anywhere in the column list, if we reorder those columns.



The relationship column and the corresponding property columns are placed in one column group.
