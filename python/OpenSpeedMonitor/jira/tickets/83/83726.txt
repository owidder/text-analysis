"22/Jun/16 11:10 AM;tsu;as discussed with sfe, the richtext should only be converted into plaintext without line breaks

Interesting, but not now: one in Scala, one in Haskell.

the linked media wiki parsers don't do the same as a XWiki parser should do. I couldn't find a real XWiki parser for Javascript. Now I could write a XWiki parser by myself or I could write something in the classic client with the Java XWiki parser where I can get the parsed rich text strings.

[MediaWiki Syntax|https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Help:Formatting]"	"23/Jun/16 8:55 AM;wfr;For the moment, we want to strip the markup tags from the XWiki (source) text, and display the rest as plain text.

In a tabular display, this is sufficient in my eyes.



So what we need is basically  ""replace all tags, that is from < to >, ignoring escaped brackets in strings, that is from "" to "", ignoring escaped quotes, with a space"".



Tactically, for the current sprint, I suggest to build the simple solution.

Sorry, but the XWiki-to-HTML Parser is not in the scope of this ticket.

* a new XWiki to plain text javascript parser should be written

* no enumeration marks should be displayed

* links should be shown with the text to display and the link itself "	"01/Jul/16 11:15 AM;pma;*Review Comments*

Everything is fine, 2 small notes:

* ListRowDataBuilder.js: please delete the TODO statement 

* listTemplateUtils.js: note that the parameter ""richtext"" in all the methods are not nullable"
