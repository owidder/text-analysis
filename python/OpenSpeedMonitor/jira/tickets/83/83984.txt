Filter-URL updating on operator selection but without value changing	"- go to N3CD

- open Filter Dialog for inner elements

- set attribute ""Costs""

- set operator ""between""

- DON'T change slider values 

expected: defined filter row appears in url with max and min values

actual: it don't



So: 

- filter is not applied. 

- reload (or language change) removes the filter.
