*to clarify*

* grouping 

** with or without two row header?)

** dragable? -> restrictions

** deletable? -> restrictions"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	10/May/16 2:07 PM	01/Jul/16 1:14 PM														"15/Jun/16 5:28 PM;wfr;@ACh ideas for simple requirements:



make those columns 

* grouped together

* with a 2-level headerDef with children

* and not draggable (user  can drag columns around the non-draggable group)

* without delete button, so we do not have to provide an extra restore action, and we do not have to deal with a single-and-two-level header. (user can still make the column narrower)



If someone really needs a more interaction-rich variant, we can do it later.

"	"20/Jun/16 11:16 AM;wfr;Story, seen by a user:



* I see a list of IS.

* I want to know the BMs in detail, not only the related BUs, BPs or Prods.

* I select ""BMs"" from the list of available columns. I cannot find the property columns of the BMs (yet).

* I see 3 new columns, grouped, of BU, BP, Prod.

* I want see even more details

* I select a column with a property of the BMs. This columns is new in the list.

* I see the property column to the right of the other BM (name) columns

* Now I do no longer care for BMs.

* I delete the BU column, then the BP and then the Prod column.

* Now I can only see the BM property column, which looks strange.

* I delete the last BM column.

* Now the list has the ""BMs"" entry again.

"	"27/Jun/16 2:36 PM;tsu;I found some Problems:



*First Problem:*

# add the Business Mapping column group

# delete one or more of the Business Mapping child columns

# add a Business Mapping child column again



-> then the new added Business Mapping child column is empty



*Second Problem:*

# add the Business Mapping column group

# delete a Business Mapping child column



-> now you can add the deleted child column multiple times, because it is not deleted in the add column list





*Third Problem:*

# add the Business Mapping column group

# delete all other columns, so there is only the BM column group

# try to delete one of the BM child columns by clicking the X symbol



-> the first time the X symbol is clicked, the cell is not deleted, but sorted. After that you can delete the column.



*Fourth Problem:*

# add the Business Mapping column group

# delete all other columns, so there is only the BM column group

# add two BM property columns to the BM column group

# delete all BM columns but the two added property columns



-> now you have two child columns, but you can't delete one of them"	"29/Jun/16 10:52 AM;aan;To third and fourth problem:



There is a problem with deleting a column if the sorted column is deleted and there is no other column that can be sorted.

The properties of relations are not sortable (as this is required).

However I changed the changes I did in that commit, because it was just a temporary change to get the jenkins green again."
