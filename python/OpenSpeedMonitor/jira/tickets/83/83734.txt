write an understandable ticket for ""not possible"", talk to WFr or SFe"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	10/May/16 11:04 AM	07/Jun/16 11:15 AM														01/Jun/16 3:26 PM;mse;The "not possible" item is specified in ITERAPLAN-4657.	"06/Jun/16 1:57 PM;abo;*Review-Comments:*

* _ListConfiguration.js_ is already outdated - it doesn't make sense to do a review for that based on this ticket.

* _ListRowDataBuilder-spec.js_ - it's irritating to configure the builder in between tests - either do the configuration at 1 central location or move it to the appropriate test as 'given' part.

* Tests in _ListColumnDefsBuilder-spec.js_ should test more special cases, e.g. input for number comparator is not a string but float, or it is formatted with a German decimal-separator (i.e. ',') or NaN; string comparator should ordering of German Umlauts in contrast to their 'normal' letters (e.g. 'a' and 'Ã¤').

* In _ListColumnDefsBuilder.js_:

** why do we need a text-comparator at all? I thought this is the default behaviour of ag-grid.

** Please further document pre-conditions of _numberComparator()_, especially the format of the string that should be provided. 

** Please also document _why_ the input for the comparators always is of type String."	"06/Jun/16 3:09 PM;mse;* _ListRowDataBuilder-spec.js_ was refactored so that the MetaModelBuilder is completely defined at the beginning for better overview.

* _ListColumnDefsBuilder-spec.js_

** Test cases for number strings with commas have been added 

** The number comparator cannot compare real numbers (or NaN) but is built for number strings as the cells of the grid contain always strings

** Test cases for German umlauts have been added

* _ListColumnDefsBuilder.js_

** A text comparator is necessary as ag-grid always sorts capital letters before small letters otherwise (as far as I remember)

** JSdoc of numberComparator is updated

** The values of the cells are always strings in our implementation of ag-grid -> JSdoc adjusted"	"06/Jun/16 4:17 PM;abo;*Review Comments #2:*

* Thanks for clarifications and adaptions!

* I've commited changes to some unit tests to make borders of the implementation explicit. Please review my test-cases whether that behavior was intended."	"07/Jun/16 11:15 AM;mse;Thanks for the additional review comments and the additional unit tests. They look good!



One additional comment: At the moment, German umlauts are not treated well, when a text column is sorted. This will be followed up in ITERAPLAN-4682."
