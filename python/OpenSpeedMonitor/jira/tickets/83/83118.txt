Attributes and self-relations as additonal columns	"*Summary:*

Add attributes and self-relations as additional columns.

This is not displayed at the legend.

This ""attribute-column"" is filled for any level if the attribute is assigned to the Building Block of this level.



*As-Is:*

* No additional columns



*To-Be:*

* Any attribute, any self-relation as well as the duration-attributes can added as additional columns.



*Affected JS-Files:*

* mpdController (transferAction)

* mpdConfiguration (store actual selected attributes and manage URL)

* mpdToolAreaViewModelBuilder

* mpdContentMain

* mpdDataService (fetch relevant attribute values)

* mpdItemBuilder (store relevant attributes in the mpdItems)

* mpdTableModelBuilder (builds attribute cells)

* mpdDiagramBuilder



*Implementation Details:*

* Apply the selected attribute/self-relation to all levels (if exists)

* For durations:

** Begin and End Date are not offered seperately in the ToolArea

** Only the name of the duration-attribute is offered in the ToolArea

** If the user selects a duration-attribute, both Begin & End column are added

* Take care on multi-value-attributes: Display multiple values in one cell with multiple lines

* For self-relations: Display mulitple self-relations in one cell with multiple lines

* Take care on the url



*UI:*

* The added columns have the same layout like the existing ones

* The additional columns are ordered alphabetically ascending

* Legend: Nothing is displayed

* ToolArea:

** Create a new ToolArea-Entry on the highest level called ""Additional columns""

** On the second level of this ToolAreaEntry are: ""Level 1"", ""Level 2"" (only if it exists), ""Level 3"" (if it exists)

** If you hover over ""Level 1"" a new list is opened to the right, which displays all attributes and self-relations for the Building Block Type of Level 1 in an alphabetical order (coming from the metamodel)
