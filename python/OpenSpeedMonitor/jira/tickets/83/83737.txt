Format multi value for properties	"Join values comma separated.

Use text sorting (for now).

Implement it in the RowDataBuilder.



Note: sorting of rows by multiple values is out of scope. See [ITERAPLAN-4651] 

multi value columns are not sortable in a correct way after this ticket."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	10/May/16 11:06 AM	08/Jun/16 12:50 PM														23/May/16 4:20 PM;abo;Stopped, because of dependency to rowData generation (ITERAPLAN-4568)	25/May/16 2:26 PM;mwe;Multi value attributes are enumeration and responsibility attributes.	01/Jun/16 10:10 AM;abo;Notes for Reviewers: there is no implementation necessary, because ag-grid renders arrays as comma-separated values. However, I added a e2e test to prove the functionality.	02/Jun/16 10:35 AM;abo;Changed XMI data - needs a DB Reset!	"02/Jun/16 10:38 AM;abo;Currently 2 E2E tests are failing and it seems because of the XMI-Data-Change:

* ""The landscape diagram.Should change the line type according to a numeric value""

* ""The landscape diagram.should filter by content hierarchy show only level 1"""	02/Jun/16 4:33 PM;abo;Fixed the tests and added a {{thenCatch()}} block to better track down errors of failing tests.	"06/Jun/16 3:36 PM;mwe;Review:

* The values are shown correctly.

* Sorting not working. (Error in Browser-Console) TextSorting (TextComparator) should be used."	06/Jun/16 6:00 PM;abo;Added unit tests and an E2E test to assure correct sorting.
