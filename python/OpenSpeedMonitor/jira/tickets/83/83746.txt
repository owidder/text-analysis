* Instead of a _ENUM_COLUMNSUFFIX_ and _BOOLEAN_COLUMNSUFFIX_ I'd rather use a _ORIGINAL_VALUE_COLUMN_SUFFIX_ for both enums and booleans. (using different suffixes for different datatypes seems a bit like hungarian notation to me).

* I'm missing unit tests for _getRankForEnumValue()_ - especially corner cases like null values or literals with length > 1."	"07/Jun/16 11:00 AM;mse;* First review comment implemented
