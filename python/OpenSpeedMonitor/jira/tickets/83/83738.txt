* Will the filter tests be implemented in the context of ITERAPLAN-4575?

* I don't understand the meaning (and get a warning...) of the following line:

{{preCloseCallback: dialogScope.dialogResetFullDialog}}

(l. 83 in ipList-component.js)

* The getFilter() function in ListConfigurations.js seems to be a duplicate of getCombinedFilter()."	"03/Jun/16 9:22 AM;pma;Comments on review comments:

* while the filter dialog is mainly implemented in the list controller, the filter tests will be included in ITERAPLAN-4575
