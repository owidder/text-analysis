"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	04/May/16 2:37 PM	05/Jun/16 4:08 PM														06/May/16 12:33 PM;dmkh;Used solid gray color for highlighting. Discrete gray color is displayed as black in downloaded SVG (reproduced in FF).	"17/May/16 3:48 PM;abo;Review Comments:

* Please use the IDE feature to format the code before checkin (Webstorm default shortcut: Ctrl + Alt + L)

* Please adda comment in _mpdConfiguration.js_ _why_ timeSpan is hardcoded (as I know from Marcel, that you are hardcoding it first, and modify that later on with other features)

* function _currentMonthNumber()_ is used with 2 parameters, but only declares 1.

* function _currentMonthNumber()_ should be renamed to e.g. _countMonthsFrom()_.

* width and height of cells should be extracted to a constant / function var.

* Should we use a date-lib for all the date operations: count months, get first date of month, first date of the year, etc.? - please check possible libraries and clarify with [~wfr]

* What's the reason behind monthsCount, yearsCount, etc. at the beginning of _mpdDiagramBuilder.js_? Seems like premature optimization to me - usually a function call (in contrast to a REST call) is not realy a performance issue, even if made 10 times."	17/May/16 4:02 PM;abo;I forgot 1 thing in my review: it is good that you defined small functions for the date-calculations. Although, they are small, there should be according unit tests, especially for special cases (like date is undefined etc.).	20/May/16 1:26 PM;dmkh;Thank you for comments/hints! Used Moment.js for date operations after conversation with Wolfgang.	"05/Jun/16 4:07 PM;msr;Thank you for the review comments and the review implementation.

Looks like all is done now."
