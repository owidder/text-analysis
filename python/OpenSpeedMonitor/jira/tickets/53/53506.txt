Reactor result download IE11 only via "page source".	"Reported by MJo, thanks.



Not yet retested.



report follows:



Using IE11, the download buttons of the reactor UI lead to a page that shows the file as text, not to a ""save as"" dialog. 

With a work around via ""show page source"", ""save page"" and careful selection of the file type, the file content can be downloaded.



Tested against local installation and demo on server.



No problems with FF.



If there is a solution by configuring the IE locally, please tell MJo, and all other users."		Bug	iteraplan PO	12/Aug/15 10:21 AM	02/Oct/15 10:07 AM
