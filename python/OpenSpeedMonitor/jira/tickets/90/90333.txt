[^SlowLogin.txt] _(7 kB)_"	"14/Jul/16 10:08 AM;cst;Dear Mr Tudor,

thank you for your enquiry. 

Would you please send us the following LOG-Files so we can check the problem.

From the conf-directory of your Tomcat-Installation:

* server.xml
* web.xml 

The “catalina.out”, “localhost.log” and ""localhost_access_log.[TIMESTAMP].txt"" the files from 
your tomcat installation (just for the period, when the error occurred). 
From [Tomcat]/webapps/[iteraplan directory]/WEB-INF/classes:

* log4j.properties

From [Tomcat]/webapps/[iteraplan directory]/META-INF:

* context.xml (This file can contain passwords -> please remove the passwords)*

The iteraplan log files from the period, when the error occurred. The files are called “iteraplan-[version].log” (for today) or „iteraplan-[version].log.[TIMESTAMP]” (for past days). The location of these file was specified during installation and is documented in the file “log4j.properties”.

Greetings,

Disabling LDAPS and hitting non ssl LDAP connections => performance is just fine. The problem seems to be more linked to Tomcat/Spring framework and solution is to configure a connection LDAP pool. 
a) Did you encounter similar issues ? 
b) Can we move to SSO with AD when we have an Apache Tomcat/Linux installation of Iteraplan ? 

Thanks and Regards "	"19/Jul/16 9:39 AM;cst;Dear Mr Tudor,



thanks for your Reply.



To Point a) No we have no similar issues you are describing. You find the configuration for the LDAP connections in the following data 

""<Tomcat instance iteraplan>\WEB-INF \ classes\iteraplan-auth.properties"". Here can you insert additional LDAP server URLs.



To Point b) For a SSO and Tomcat/Linux environment have we no experience with that. In our example 



https://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan52/Single+Sign+On 



we are using a Windows Server for the configuration. We cannot support you with the setup of a Linux System and SSO because we can only support issues within iteraplan and not in the surrounding environment. But in principle a SSO-setup on Linux could be possible to authenticate users in iteraplan. But we have no experience with that.

 

When you want to change the authentification from ""LDAP"" to ""SSO and LDAP"" download the applicationContext-spring-security.xml form this ticket. 



[^applicationContext-spring-security.xml]



Afterwards, you change this file in following path 



""<Tomcat instance iteraplan>\WEB-INF\"".



At last you must configure the SSO in the file ""iteraplan-auth.properties"".
