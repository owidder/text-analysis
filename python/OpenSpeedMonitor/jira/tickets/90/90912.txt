Add the UI components for configuration of the saved queries and URL	"* If the XSLT file is highlighted in the file browser the config should be shown in the file info container on the right.

* Regarding the UI the configuration of the saved queries (IPTQ-8) and URL (IPTQ-7) should be independent of the configuration -> See [^Graphics Reactor UI.png]

* Use the modal dialog created in IPTQ-6 via that the user can configure the following parameters per XSLT script:

** Publish through URL:

*** Name of result file to be returned. The result file is a file that is generated by the XSLT script. If the script does not generate a file with the configured file name no result will be returned.  (e.g. ""output.xml""). The folder that contains the script also contains the result file.

*** Unique string that is the last URL part via that the script result can be accessed. (e.g. ""hugo"")

*** Comma separated list of roles that can access the script result. Only input field, no selection. (e.g. ""admin,root"")

*** Time value in hours used as cache time limit. (e.g. ""10"").

** Saved Queries

*** The user can enter a list of saved query ids. The list format should be ""1,4,6,2"" (text input only, comma separated list). The IDs are those from the saved queries in the classic client. The ID of a query is visible in the generated external link to that query as a parameter value. Integrate the edit function with the file browser."

* -Test with real REST backend (waiting for IPTQ-26)-"	"02/Aug/16 9:17 AM;tam;-No support for startsWith and endsWith in IE-

Forget it"	"02/Aug/16 9:30 AM;tam;If you open the edit dialog the name of script file won't be displayed. You only see Edit Configuration of Script """"



If you save a config, you don't get any success or failure message / sign / something"	02/Aug/16 10:57 AM;tam;The check if the file is xsl(t) one is also done in FileManager. Maybe the functionality can be shared in a common reactor util	"02/Aug/16 11:19 AM;tam;Check ""Execute saved queries prior to the script"", click in ""Saved query ids"", don't fill anything, uncheck the box again



The field is red.



The same for roles"	"02/Aug/16 11:47 AM;mwe;Fixed the display of the script name in the modal dialog.

The message toast will be done in IPTQ-74.

The red input fields are ok, this is angular material."
