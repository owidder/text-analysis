Option: Scaling: "Activated" or "Deactivated"	"*Summary:*

Implement scaling-option, i.e. Scaling active means: if a diagram is filtered and does not have all values from minimum to maximum, use the *minium value of the result set* as new minimum and the *maximum value of the result set* as new maximum.



*Implementation Details:*

* Default is deactivated

* Url: Save option in url

* If scaling is active, deactive the fixed initial number of sections



*UI:*

* Legend: Only show in the legend if it is activated: ""Display"" \n ""Scaling is active"" (German: ""Anzeige"" \n ""Skalierung ist aktiv"")

* Toolarea:

** Main entry (last position): ""Display"" (German: ""Anzeige"")

** Subentry: Toggle-Button ""Activate scaling vs ""Deactivate scaling"" (German: ""Skalierung aktivieren"" vs. ""Skalierung dekativieren"")"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	13/Jul/16 5:05 PM	29/Aug/16 2:54 PM														"11/Aug/16 11:45 AM;dmkh;* {quote}If scaling is active, deactive the fixed initial number of sections{quote}

[~msr], please, specify this requirement: you mean *_recalculate number of sections after applying new ranges for numeric axis_*?



* {quote}Legend: Only show in the legend if it is activated: ""Display"" \n ""Scaling is active""{quote}

There already exist Settings section in the legend with _""Including Information Systems connected over an Interface""_ option. Can we also add _""Scaling is active""_ to this section or is it needed to create separate Display section?



* *Special case:* scaling is activated, we have filtered our set and only one element is left (min=max). What shall we do in this situation? I'd suggest to have some default scaling range for such case but which one (maybe depending on size of the bubble)?



* *Also*: are enum attributes in scope of this ticket? If yes, should we *_remove section for appropriate value of enum attribute without any element in it_* (as was discussed on sprint planning)? And please, update ticket description with details mentioned above.



Thanks.

"	"16/Aug/16 1:46 PM;msr;1. Answer:

* Yes, recalculate the number of sections with new min and new max values. Minimum and maxium of sections is still 3 to 12. Please remove ""unspecified""-section for active scaling.



2. Answer: Yes, put it to settings



3. Answer: Use value-1 as new minimum and value+1 = new maximum



4. Answer: Yes, please remove section for appropriate value of enum attribute without any element in it (this also applies to unspecified-column)."	"23/Aug/16 2:18 PM;roia;review: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-14

There're some questions."	"23/Aug/16 2:30 PM;dmkh;[~msr], there are some points needed to be specified in this ticket to close it:

# What should we show for enum attribute on both axes if scaling is active and all items are filtered (currently nothing but axes are shown)?

# Are negative numeric values available for items?

# Which min\max range for numeric attribute must be shown if all items are filtered (currently *_from 0 to 1_*)?

# Which min\max range for numeric attribute must be shown if min = max (currently *_from (min - min = 0) to (2 * min)_*, so items are in the middle of the grid)?

# Which min\max range for numeric attribute must be shown if min = max = 0 (currently *_from 0 to 1_*)?"	"25/Aug/16 8:42 AM;msr;[~dmkh]: Here are my answers:



1. The current behaviour looks like that the diagram is broken. I would prefer, that we show an empty diagram like without scaling (i.e. the scaling-option does not have any effect in this special case)

2. No

3. Let's use the same behaviour like in 1. (for enums): The min and max remain unchanged in this special case.

4. That's ok.

5. That's ok"	"25/Aug/16 9:03 AM;msr;[~dmkh]: Additional requirement:

Rename this feature from ""scaling"" to ""cropping"", i.e.



* Legend: Only show in the legend if it is activated: ""Display"" \n ""Cropping is active"" (German: ""Anzeige"" \n ""Achsen sind zugeschnitten"")

* Toolarea:

** Main entry (last position): ""Display"" (German: ""Anzeige"")

** Subentry: Toggle-Button ""Activate cropping vs ""Deactivate cropping"" (German: ""Zuschneiden der Achsen"" vs. ""Achsen komplett zeigen"")
