Diagrams in interactive client don't link to the items like the PDF reports	it would be great if the items shown in the interactive client would contain the links to e.g. the information systems like it is the case in the PDF report.

thank you for your enquiry.

We are working full steam to develop the interactive client with new features.

There is currently no definite date for this feature.
