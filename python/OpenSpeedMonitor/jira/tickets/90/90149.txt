create folders		80573	Sub-task	iteraplan Quickfox	11/Jul/16 2:34 PM	28/Jul/16 3:59 PM														19/Jul/16 11:08 AM;tsu;For Server side look at commit 25580 from IPTQ-3	"20/Jul/16 2:52 PM;tam;1. It's not possible to create folder with special characters (e.g. #111, +111) from UI. 



- Disscussed requirement on the folder name with [~mwe]: all characters allowed by file system should be allowed by file manager



But actually you can create folders with such names on the file system and these folders will be displayed then on ui.

But there are some strange behaviours:

- folder starting with # will be displayed as if there would subfolders exists with the same name

- if you try to open folder which name starts with +, you'll get ""Error 500 - Bridge response error, please check the API docs or this ajax response."" After this the only way is to reload reactor.



2. If a folder created on the file system is the first one, then it will be displayed as opened by open any other folders beside the last one in the list. It's not possible to make this folder as ""closed"". The only way to close this folder either to click the root folder or the last one. It seems that there are similar problems with the last folder.
