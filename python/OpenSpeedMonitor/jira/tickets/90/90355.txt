Sizing by attribute	"*Summary:*

The elements are sized by *single valued* numeric or enumeration attributes.



*Implementation Details:*

* There is a absolut minimum and a maxium size in pixel

* Undefined values have minimum size with a dashed line

* Numeric attributes: The sizing is exact within the limits

* Enum: The interval between minium and maximum size is divided in equal sections depending on the number of intervals, e.g.

** if minSize = 2, maxSize = 6 and we have three literals, then literal1 has size 2, literal2 has size 4 and literal3 has size 6

* Url: Save attribute for sizing in the url

* Remove border line around circles (except for dashed line of undefined values)

* Sorting:

** If sizes are equal, use the name or (if activated) the hiearchical name as criterion.



*UI:*

* Synchronise zoom-factor of the diagram with sizes of circles in the legend

* BUT limit sizes of circle to a minimum and maxium

* Legend: Show in the legend:

** Numeric: ""Size by"" (German: ""Größe bestimmt durch"") localised attribute name, 5 circles starting with min and ending with max and 1 circle for undefined

** Enumeration: ""Size by"" (German: ""Größe bestimmt durch"") localised attribute name, 1 circle for each literal and 1 circle for undefined

* Toolarea:

** New main entry (3. position): ""Size"" (German: ""Größe"")

** First subentry: ""Default sizing"" (German: ""Standard Größe"") to reset the sizing

** Subentries: All single-valued numeric and enumeration attributes order alphabetically by their localised names. The actual seleceted is highlighted in bold
