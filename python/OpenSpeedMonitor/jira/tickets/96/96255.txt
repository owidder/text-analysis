Implement new History	"*TODO*: split to subtasks/subtickets (perhaps one per point)



* create hibernate mappings and entities

* create *DAO* for new hisotry (see new db table schema)

* create *HistoryService* that writes history entries using DAO

* history service should be used in general *Model Changes Event Listener*



*New table in DB for history:*

* one table (hibernate entity) for each Building Block Type (both standalone and assoc. building block types)

* SCHEMA:

** *Timestamp*

** *building block id* - of affected building block

** *change type* - update, insert, delete

** *feature id* -  for not built in proerpties (leave null for default properties)

** *feature persistent name* -  properties and relationship end points

** for assoc. building blocks *id's of relation ends* (for referencing)

** *from value* - for single and multivalues

** *to value* - for single and multivalues



(!) changes on associations (e.g. CRUD in Isr2BoAssociation or new relation creation) should be written only into the IS2BO-HIST table, but not into IS or Bo history!
