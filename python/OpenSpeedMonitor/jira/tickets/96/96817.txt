Mappings and entities	"One table for each building block type

For standalone types

* One entity class

* separate table per type

* See http://stackoverflow.com/questions/16755260/hibernate-two-tables-per-one-entity for inspiration.

* Schema as follows:

** Timestamp

** author - Name of the user which committed the changes

** building block id - of affected building block

** change type - update, insert, delete

** feature id - if applicable, as for example for user-defined attributes

** feature persistent name - display name of the relationship or attribute/property

** removed value - for single value assignment features, this is equivalent to the ""from"" value

** added value - for single value assignment features, this is equivalent to the ""to"" value



For associative types (Isr2Bo, Transport, etc.):

* One entity class per type

* one table per type

* Schema as above, plus two more columns: for example ID_IS and ID_BO for Isr2Bo



For Business Mapping:

* As for associative types, only one column for each of the business mapping relations: ID_IS, ID_BP, ID_BU, ID_PROD



One table and entity for attribute changes:

* Timestamp

* attribute id

* attribute name

* change type - delete, assignment removed

* building block type"	96255	Sub-task	iteraplan Thunderduck	21/Sep/16 11:12 AM	26/Sep/16 2:31 PM
