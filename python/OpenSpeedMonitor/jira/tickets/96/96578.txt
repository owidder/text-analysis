Issues with subscribed users	"See linked ticket.

 That specific issue was fixed by fetching the subscribedUsers collection eagerly.

 But the behavior that on a normal load, the collection - in some cases - did not contain the correct elements, and some of the behavior witnessed in the classic UI related to this, indicate possible issues with caching.

 These merit further investigation to make sure there aren't any other hidden problems."		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	19/Sep/16 3:08 PM	07/Mar/17 10:25 AM					cache									02/Mar/17 5:53 PM;fka;Timebox 0,25 PD
