Elements with status "Inactive"	"Removing the check mark of “Elements with status ‘Inactive’ are shown” in the Administration > Configuration page does not seem to work ... or we are not using it properly.  Please advice.  Below are two cases done after removing this check mark and using the classic client.



1) Free-text search in the systems building block will also show systems with the status ""Inactive""



2) Running a visualization, e.g. master plan diagram where the first level is a query on projects and the second level are the relations to systems, will also include ""Inactive"" systems"		Fault	iteraplan Support	14/Sep/16 5:46 PM	16/Sep/16 1:14 PM														"15/Sep/16 8:57 AM;cst;Dear Mr. Callisen,
Dear Mr. Siebel,

thank you for your enquiry.

_The Configuration page provides options with which every user can choose whether to display or to hide elements with the status Inactive. With the default setting, elements in Inactive status are included in information displays. Any change to this setting is valid only for one session; if you wish to exclude inactive elements from the display, you have to make the change explicitly each time you log on._

In many diagrams and the search, this option has no effect. 

For  e.g. the masterplan diagram you could configurate the ""Properties of the queried Information Systems"", for not display the ""inactive"" systems. 

Greetings,
