Save LastLoaded into database	"The timestamp when the saved query was loaded the last time should be saved in the database.



Add lastLoaded timestamp to DB metainfo of a saved query (save the timestamp in the same format as the lastUpdated timestamp delivered in the JSON): 

{code}""lastLoaded"": ""Sep 21, 2016 10:50:43 AM""{code}

* Adjust PUT - REST interface that it does not change the lastLoaded timestamp.

* If a specific SQ is loaded per the REST backend interface update the lastLoaded timestamp

* Add possibility to REST interface to read the lastLoaded timestamp

* Adjust DB Entity to make it possible to save the lastLoaded timestamp into the metainfo

* Adjust DB Entity to change only parts of the entity if not all parameters are sent by a PUT request.
