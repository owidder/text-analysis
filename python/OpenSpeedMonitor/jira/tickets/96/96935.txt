RELEASE: 500 error on PUT user/settings in Browser console	"One request works well, and another one (just after the previous one) gives error. See screenshots.

Has something to do with ""featureName1"" parameter."		Bug	iteraplan Quickfox	22/Sep/16 1:21 PM	25/Oct/16 9:25 AM														27/Sep/16 3:50 PM;mwe;I saw the error before but I cannot reproduce it.	"21/Oct/16 12:51 PM;roia;[~mwe] I've attached a screenshot of a good and bad request. The difference is that {{setting}} property is once a string-type property (which gives and error) and, in the other case, it's object which is handled well.

Hope, this information helps and looks like it's UserSettings service issue."	24/Oct/16 2:44 PM;sfe;Issue seems to be only with HSQLDB
