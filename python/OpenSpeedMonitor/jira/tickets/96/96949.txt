Graphics Reactor doesn't work at FireFox 45	If I try to open the Graphics Reactor in FireFox 45 nothing happens. With IE11 all works fine.		Fault	iteraplan Support	22/Sep/16 3:07 PM	27/Sep/16 10:30 AM														"22/Sep/16 3:15 PM;cst;Hallo Mr. Liskow,

thank you for your inquire. 

I checked the Graphics Reactor in Firefox 45 and it opens without any problems. 
Would you please check the console of your browser and the tomcat server for more information to analyse the problem.

Do you need the tomcat info, too?

[^iteraplan-PROD-logs-23.09.2016.zip] _(159 kB)_"	"23/Sep/16 10:54 AM;cst;I found no entry for the IE in the logfiles, can you please check the Graphic Reactor with the IE again?
After that, in the catalina.2016-09-23.log and iteraplan53.log a new entry is created. 

Would you please check this and send me the both files. 

This problem is really strange, when the IE is opening the Graphic Reactor but the Firefox is creating this error. 
Have the Firefox and the Internet Explorer the same proxy server settings in the domain?

we checked the Log-Files again and we found the reason of the error. 

It must be a problem with the chache in Firefox. 



The route from the Graphics Reactor is in Version 5.2 following:  ""*Route Changed to js/reactor/reactorTemplate.html*"" 

In Version 5.3:  ""*Route Changed to js/reactor/reactor-template.htm*"".



Would please check chache and cookies in Firefox.

Christoph Stangl - iteraplan Support "	"27/Sep/16 10:29 AM;thomas.liskow@coface.com;Hello Mr. Stangl,

I cleared the cache for the new client with STRG + F5 - and it works now.

Thanks for your quick support. You could close the incident.

Kind regards,
Thomas Liskow"
