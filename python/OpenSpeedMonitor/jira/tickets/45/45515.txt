Unreachable elements if the context menu is too long	Since the menu is fixed and doesn't scroll, when it gets too long some elements become unreachable. This isn't very tragic since you can just close the longest accordion (in most cases "open elements") or close some elements to make space, but it isn't very pretty.

Might get fixed with new UI changes where OpenElements are not showing all, but merely the last 5 (Stack-behaviour)."	08/Jun/12 12:58 PM;lci;This issue was kinda a duplicate of ITERAPLAN-679.
