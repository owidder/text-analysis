Bulk Update of Description field: Only the "Add link or file"-button of the first element works; "Add"-Button for finally adding link or file does not work at all	Start a Bulk Update and choose "Description" as property to be updated. No matter which "Add link or file"-button of the different elements you click, always the "Add link or file"-tab of the first element will open. If you fill out the necessary fields and then click on the "Add" button, nothing happens. With every click on an "Add file or link"-button of an arbitrary element, the tab of the first one opens and closes.

Adding links or files still bugged:
- after filling out all the necessary fields, the link/file is actually added to the description only for the first entry of the list. For all other entries, nothing happens after clicking on ""add"".
- if a file/link is added for the first entry, clicking ""add"" on another element, even trying to add a completly different file/link, will add the first entry's previously attached file/link. Example: bulk update for IS1 and IS2, IS1 being the first entry of the list. You add the link ""https://link1"" to IS1, which works fine. Afterwards, you try to add the link ""https://differentlink"" to IS2. Nevertheless, ""https://link1"" is added to IS2.
NB: hadn't we added ""link1"" to IS1 first, trying to add ""differentlink"" to IS2 wouldn't cause any reaction to begin with."	14/Dec/11 10:16 PM;kvo;works for me. Which browser did you test, Luca?	15/Dec/11 9:18 AM;lci;I tested with Firefox 8.0. I'll try again, maybe with IE too, and report.	19/Dec/11 10:39 AM;vsh;Links are added to the right element.	19/Dec/11 10:42 AM;vsh;In the most browsers, adding a file to the descriptions omits the right path to the file or adds a fake one (e.g in Chrome). Is this OK or can we try to find a better solution? This has the side effect that the added links to the files cannot be used to download, open or view the file.

Please adjust if necessary"
