Corrupted layout on Definitions page	"On the definitions page (""About iteraplan / Definitions""), the main content is displaced due to the hidden/removed context actions menu. This can vary dependent on the previous page.

Remove the Javascript-""hack"", which hides the context actions menu AND the breadcrumbs from this page:
/iteraplan3x_trunk/WebContent/jsp/StartContent.jsp

Add a property like ""hideContextActionMenu"" / ""hideBreadcrumbs"" to the affected JSPs, to enable hiding of these two components on the start and help page.

(x) active dialog property of the GuiContext is not reset when calling the help page => context menu might be shown if the previous dialog had a context menu and the menu highlighting is also applied as for the previous dialog.
fix this by implementing a Controller for the help page similarly to the StartController just calling {code}guiContext.updateGuiContext(null);{code}"	"22/May/13 4:52 PM;bra;(x) still not working correctly.

To reproduce the undesired behavior:
* navigate to the Administration > Templates page 
* afterwards navigate to the definitions page
=> context menu is displayed
* navigate to the start page
* navigate to the definitions page
=> context menu is hidden"	"23/May/13 6:08 PM;lba;I asked Steffen, what the expected behavior of the context menu is: it should have the same behavior as the visualization-overview-page
"	24/May/13 9:22 AM;bra;(/) looks good now, context menu is displayed regardless what page was displayed before
