Improve installation documentation	"Setting up iteraplan 3.1 EE, I noticed the following documentation issues:

h3. Page: https://www.iteraplan.de/wiki/display/iteraplan/Tomcat+Configuration
Section: Limit Maximum Number of Request-processing Threads

On 2 of the 3 Connectors, the setting URIEncoding=""UTF-8"" is missing. This setting has to be set according to the previous section. (/)


h3. Page: https://www.iteraplan.de/wiki/display/iteraplan/Tomcat+Configuration
Section: Memory Settings

The setting ""-Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true"" is only mentioned in the second configuration. Does it really not have to be set in the Windows GUI configuration, too? Additionally, I would suggest to make a statement about possible side-effects (/), as this option has to be set globally on the server and therefore also affects other applications running in the same Tomcat. It would be better if iteraplan could define this setting somewhere in its own code, so that it does not affect any other applications.

Is it really necessary to include the JDBC driver twice in the ZIP-file?

""default_storage_engine"" instead of ""default-storage-engine""
The setting is already set by default in recent MySQL versions (as ""InnoDB"" instead of ""INNODB"", but this should not make any difference)

There should be a comment about possible side-effects regarding the property ""lower_case_table_names"" (/). This setting is set globally and thus affects other databased hosted on the same DBMS, too. It should be possible to set this property in the iteraplan SQL scripts/commands (and ideally the default storage engine, too) and leave the defaults untouched? If you include it in your own scripts the setup configuration effort would be lower, there would not be potential side-effects for other applications and the support would be easier, too, as these settings can then be assumed as set (same with the Tomcat Java sort settings mentioned above).

Also, that the second installation should create a WAR instance named "iteraplan-ldap", not just "iteraplan". This was a significant learning experience for us when setting up LDAP. In fact, in general, I think the whole LDAP section needs help. :-)	16/Aug/13 1:13 AM;bbergman;On MySQL 5.1 (linux, redhat), "show variables" doesn't show the default storage engine value (not sure why, though). I had to do a "show engines" to see which one was the default. Also, I would recommend that you indicate the section that the variables should be in (i.e., "[mysqld]"). 	16/Aug/13 1:15 AM;bbergman;The text-based installer doesn't mention what should be entered if the user doesn't want a value. For example, in the second question about installing iturm, it doesn't say whether you should say "no", "n" or what. A positive value is easy enough to grok, but a helpful message about negative responses would be appreciated.

"18/Oct/13 11:06 AM;psc;Reviewed. Also added some improvements.

Short summary:
* Point 1 (URIEncoding=""UTF-8""): corrected 
* Point 2 (useLegacyMergeSort=true): 
** The textfield in the mentioned screenshot is to small to show all configurations. For now, the explicit information below must be sufficient.
** Statement about side-effects was added
* Point 3 (JDBC-Driver): this is regarded a feature. Currently no need to fix this.
* Point 4 (default-storage-engine): 
** According to comment from Bernhard, the current configuration istructions seem correct
** An info-block about side-effects was added
* Point 5 (mark-up): Link was corrected

Ticket will be closed."
