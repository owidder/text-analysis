Add support for uploading a Excel 2007 template file	"In 
Administration -> Document Templates
there is currently no possibility to upload a Excel 2007 template file (xlsx). Whereas Excel 2003 (xls) can be uploaded.

The templates can be chosen as base file for the tabular reporting."	45630	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	03/May/13 2:37 PM	22/May/13 4:42 PM					excel	ui								03/May/13 2:38 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Don't forget: TemplatesDialogMemory	"10/May/13 10:32 AM;jme@iteratec.de;integrate it in the xls-upload

Header: Excel (XLSX, XLS) - These document templates can be used with the spreadsheet reports "	"13/May/13 10:02 AM;jme@iteratec.de;The TemplateDialogMemory uses the TemplateTypes to create a list of available document templates.
In the Templates/Manage.jsp the list is used to iteratively build up the different upload-sections.

So, if I use this mechanism the support for Excel 2007 comes for free.
If I integrate Excel 2003 and 2007 in one upload, I have to either define the sections explicitely in the Manage.jsp or duplicate the TemplateTypes, tailored to the needs of the template upload."	"21/May/13 2:13 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Decision:
Leave Excel 2003 and 2007 separated (less effort).

Add the hint, where to use these templates."	22/May/13 4:42 PM;bra;(/) works
