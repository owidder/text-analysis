The function "Elements with status 'Inactive' are shown." does not work properly for Technical Components.	"1. Make sure that Technical Components with status ""inactive"" do exist.
2. Go to Administration -> Configuration -> disable the function ""Elements with status 'Inactive' are shown.""
3. Go to Technical Components. Inactive elements are still shown, but should disappear due to the recently changed function."		Bug	iteraplan PO	27/Sep/11 11:45 AM	29/Sep/11 11:49 AM					Configuration
