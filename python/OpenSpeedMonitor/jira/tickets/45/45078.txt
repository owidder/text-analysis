Document syntax for full-text searches	"Our full-text search functionality uses Apache Lucene behind the scenes, which comes with a specific search query string syntax.

This implies that query terms may be transformed, several special characters are dropped, or searches cannot be executed in the way most users would expect.

The query syntax shall be concisely documented in iteraplan's documentation. A link to this docu and/or a summary of the syntax could be included in the search dialog (Reports -> Search).
Generic documentation can be found here, but we should extract the relevant parts and adapt it to iteraplan."		Task	iteraplan PO	05/Aug/11 2:54 PM	06/Sep/11 4:09 PM					documentation
