Saved Query handles filtered elements incorrectly when it has been created via Configure from Visualization tab on the element page	"To reproduce:
* Open a bb element, e.g. an information system
* Open ""Visualization"" tab and select ""Information Flow""
* After clicking on ""Configure"", save the query
=> after loading the saved query, the number of ""selected Information Systems"" has changed"		Bug	iteraplan PO	20/Feb/13 2:07 PM	05/Aug/13 10:20 AM					diagram	usability	visualization							01/Aug/13 9:53 AM;sfe;Fix works fine for Information Flow Diagrams, but should be extended to other types of context visualizations as well	"02/Aug/13 3:34 PM;sfe;Using sample data:
Using a landscape diagram on the visualization tab of an information system and clicking ""configure"" gives a landscape configuration with 38 selected information systems. That's the number of all information systems with status ""current"" which are productive today (at the time of writing 2nd of august 2013) which is the default query for information systems.
Saving the landscape diagram and loading again results in 52 information systems selected, which are all information systems regardless of status and runtime period."	05/Aug/13 10:20 AM;lba;Did configuring and saving queries for masterplan- and landscape-diagram, after reloading them the correct number of Information System is present. I also applied some filter on the Information System, still the correct number of IS is present after reloading the saved query.	17/Sep/13 9:45 AM;psc;Reviewed. Fix is working. Ticket will be closed.
