Check wording on hierarchy	"""Hierarchy"" is used inconsistently on multiple places in iteraplan:

# InformationSystems are marked as hierarchic but there is no possibility to display them as tree
# the hierarchy tab in BBs detail pages does not only contain hierarchy informations but all to-many self-relationship information
# even technical component, not marked as hierarchically on the startscreen, has a tab for hierarchy displaying the self-relationships
