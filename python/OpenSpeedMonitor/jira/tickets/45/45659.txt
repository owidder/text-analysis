Add support for Excel 2007 file format (XLSX) for the elastic model Import and Export (excel2)	"* Update the POI library to v3.9
* Update upload validation logic etc. so that xlsx and xlsm files are accepted and fed into the normal import logic.
* On the Export/Import page, add another button column which offers export in xlsx format

The file contents and table structures should be identical, regardless whether it is the binary Excel 2003 or the XML-based 2007 file format.

Most importantly, test import and export carefully, as we don't know yet how well POI supports the new file format. Keep a close eye on (at least) the following aspects:
* performance
* date fields/ cells
* numbers in text cells
* empty cells
* leading or trailing whitespace for text or numbers or dates
* identical visual appearance for exported files, i.e. correct functionality of row hiding, formula computation, cell heights, colouring, worksheet naming and ordering, range name definition, dropdown and validation constraint definition, hyperlinks

In order to maintian the ability to add macros later on, the mechanism is left unchanged.

In case of Excel 2007: we start with a xlsx-Template, knowing that the template loading mechanism has to be extended when xlsm (means: template with macros) should be used as well."	"10/Apr/13 1:53 PM;jme@iteratec.de;ToDo: 
JMeter Test: parallel Export Full Model in Excel 2007-Format 
Target: analyse performance and memoryusage"	11/Apr/13 5:55 PM;lba;[ITERAPLAN-1345] The dropdown-menus, in the relationship rows, work fine with the excel export 2003, but they don't work with the excel export 2007.	"12/Apr/13 12:56 PM;jme@iteratec.de;There is an error in the interpretation of the argument of setSuppressDropDownArrow in POI 3.9
for XSSF Workbooks. The arrow is suppressed if the argument is set to 'false' instead of 'true'.
In HSSF Workbooks the method works as designed.
Luckily in both cases the default behavior is, that the arrow is displayed. So we can skip the explicit setting of this behavior."	"15/Apr/13 9:01 AM;jme@iteratec.de;A bug report for poi has been filed:

"	"15/Apr/13 3:06 PM;sfe;Observations:
* *performance* - template generation for both xls as xlsx is kind of slow. xlsx template is noticably smaller than xls (~1.8mb vs >7mb).
* *date fields/ cells* - working fine
* *numbers in text cells* - working fine
* *empty cells* - working fine
* *leading or trailing whitespace for text or numbers or dates* - Leading space in cells for date attributes cause the cell content to be ""text"" and an according error is reported on the UI when trying to import such a file. Leading and trailing spaces in number cells are only possible when explicitely formatting as text, which results in a similar error message. Text cell contents are trimmed. Working fine.
* *identical visual appearance for exported files, i.e. correct functionality of row hiding, formula computation, cell heights, colouring, worksheet naming and ordering, range name definition, dropdown and validation constraint definition, hyperlinks* - column ordering is in both variants partially non-deterministic (no explicit ordering of property columns), else working fine

I didn't notice any further irregularities."	"15/Apr/13 3:19 PM;sfe;* Looking at the first changeset in this ticket, something with the encoding of the german properties file seems to be weird. iteraplan still looks right in my browsers, so it may not be a big problem.
* xlsm files can't be uploaded

Please fix the import for xlsm files and take a look at the properties file to make sure whether it's alright like this."	15/Apr/13 4:16 PM;jme@iteratec.de;The german property file is allright (both, customised zeiss version and standard iteraplan version).	15/Apr/13 5:02 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Added the possibility to upload xlsm files.	16/Apr/13 5:05 PM;ase;Tested import and export functionalities both locally and on nightly-build, checked improvements described on the comments, code reviewed	17/Apr/13 1:30 PM;sry;Thx!
