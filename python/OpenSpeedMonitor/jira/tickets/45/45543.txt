IE8 cannot download saved Excel reports over HTTPS connections	"A customer found that bookmarked links to saved reports cannot be downloaded, because IE show an error message. 

""Internet Explorer was not able to open this Internet site. The requested site is either unavailable or cannot be found.""

This is most probably related to the behaviour documented in http://support.microsoft.com/kb/316431/en-us, though it's slightly different. Surprisingly, the error message does not appear if the report is requested from within the application. It shows only when the URL is pasted into a new tab, and only for the first request in that tab. Subsequent request within that tab work fine...

After a similar problem last year, we have modified the headers already to be like this:
{code}
Pragma: token-prevent-IE-from-hickup
Cache-Control: private, no-store, max-age=1800
{code}

The trouble seems to be caused by ""no-store"" this time. If I change the headers with a proxy to be
{code}
Pragma: token-prevent-IE-from-hickup
Cache-Control: private, must-revalidate, max-age=1800
{code}
then it works. So, iteraplan should send above headers for the comfort of IE8."
