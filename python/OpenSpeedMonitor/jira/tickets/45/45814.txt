Excel Importer should be able to handle empty rows and coloumns	"This problem is split in two parts, both having caused trouble for customers previously.

The first part causes the excel importer to stop looking for further attributes when encountering an empty cell in the hidden machine-readable part of the header definitions. All attributes behind this attribute will be ignored without further notice.
This can cause trouble when a customer manually adds a new attribute in XML, but fails to add content of the hidden header, since he will not get an error notification of any kind.
It could easily be fixed by, instead of breaking when encountering an empty cell, iterating to the last filled cell. The number of this cell can be obtained by {{Row#getgetLastCellNum()}}. Occurrences of empty cells could easily be logged and proper error messages indicating false formatting should be displayed.

The second part is a problem that can cause trouble if a customer has, for some formatting or filtering reasons, empty lines in an Excel Sheet containing a number of elements that should be changed via Excel import.
A possible fix would be, just like in part one, to iterate until the last row. The number of this row can be obtained by {{Sheet#getLastRowNum()}}. 
However, since the sheet is set to have a high pre-defined number of rows in order to provide formatting for manually added elements, this would cause way more operations than necessary.
Explicitly initializing these rows might not be necesary though, since a default cell style can be set by {{Sheet#setDefaultCell()}}"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	01/Jul/13 3:24 PM	30/Dec/15 2:53 PM					error	excel	import	message	usability
