Masterplan diagram - some date intervals are not labelled the same way	"Create the masterplan diagram for level 1 IS and choose productive from/until, development interval and replacement interval as time intervals. Create masterplan diagram. Some date intervals are shown differently than others.

The bar in the masterplan diagram shown for productive from/until shows the name of the IS
The bars in the masterplan diagram  shown for development interval and replacement interval show the name of the interval

This should be harmonized, e.g. my proposal: always show interval name as text in the bars."		Bug	iteraplan PO	21/Jun/13 2:05 PM	26/Jun/13 11:32 AM					dateinterval	masterplan
