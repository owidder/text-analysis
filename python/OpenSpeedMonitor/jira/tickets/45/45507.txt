No access to your own profile	It may be that you do not have access to your own profile (e.g. Joe).		Bug	iteraplan PO	20/Apr/12 3:13 PM	30/Apr/12 9:35 AM					permissions									27/Apr/12 4:56 PM;gph;Problem was, that the login name of Service/DAO is lower case, but the login name of UserContext was the same as in the login dialog. The functionality to see one's own profile had already been implemented in the JSP, but the checking method "isLoggedInUserSelected()" didn't care for case sensitivity.	30/Apr/12 9:35 AM;mba;Users can access own profile now (even with empty "default_role")
