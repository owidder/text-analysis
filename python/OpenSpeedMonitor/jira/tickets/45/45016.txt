Wrong colors for bar diagram when showing the maintenance state of attribute types	If you create a bar diagram with the diagram type "Attributes" and the colour settings to show the maintenance state, the resulting bars are shown in always the same colour, independent from what was selected before. Also both possible segments (for "has a value" and "has no value") are shown in the same colour.

Fixed now.	28/Jun/11 10:47 AM;rbe;  It seems to work fine with the colours. A small issue however occurs in computation of the lenght (split of attribute values) of the attribute bars. 	28/Jun/11 1:33 PM;rbe;  passt so, die Breite ist länger für Mehrfachzuordnungen (wie z:b: in den Fall "Accountatbility")
