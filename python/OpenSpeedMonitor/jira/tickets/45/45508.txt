UI: scroll state/page position not retained while editing	"Editing InformationSystem -> add projects -> page jumps not back to projects
This was already changed in new UI, maybe lci did it? in ITERAPLAN-592?
Maybe iteratec-Function JS?"		Bug	iteraplan PO	23/Apr/12 10:41 AM	27/Apr/12 2:45 PM					usability									24/Apr/12 12:46 PM;vsh;There are problems in IE (tested with IE 9).	"24/Apr/12 4:15 PM;lci;It looks like the two functionalities can't coexist in IE. There is neither a possibility to deactivate the scrolling of the focus function, nor can the order of the functions be influenced like in FF and Chrome (though I don't understand why, jQuery adds them to the list just the same way).

How important is the focussing of the name field exactly? It isn't activated on other BBs (though that's a bug in the script actually), but nobody seemed to miss it. "	24/Apr/12 4:46 PM;lci;Another possibility (thanks to Steffen) would be setting a variable in the scope, so that the textfield gets focussed only when the edit page is opened for the first time. I will look into that asap.	26/Apr/12 2:19 PM;vsh;Scrolling works, however the name field is not focused in IE when you want to create a new element or copy/create new release of an existing one. The name field receives the focus only when you choose to edit the element.
