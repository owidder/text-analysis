Searchable Edit	The drop down lists in edit mode shall be replaced with text fields that offer the user a list of possible options to chose from upon entering a search value in the field. The option list can be generated using AJAX calls.		New Feature	iteraplan PO	30/Nov/11 9:31 AM	23/Jan/12 11:28 AM					edit									09/Dec/11 11:20 AM;sry;The current state seems to have a side-effect on the context graphics tab, or ITERAPLAN-27 has resurrected independently. Please keep an eye on the visualizations tab, and open a new ticket if the button doesn't reappear after syntax errors have been fixed..	09/Dec/11 11:43 AM;vsh;Fixed. It was caused by the JavaScript error.	19/Dec/11 11:06 AM;bsi;It'd be good if attributes' drop down lists are searchable too (e.g ENUM attributes)	19/Dec/11 11:32 AM;bsi;Please update the documentation.	"20/Dec/11 2:53 PM;kvo;Not working in FF in our online demosystems, see http://www.iteraplan.de/iteraplan_ee_demo/
Might be due to Javascript from UserVoice-Feedback?"	20/Dec/11 4:54 PM;kvo;It would be nice to have a feedback error message if something gets not saved (e.g. same IS as sub-IS)	21/Dec/11 11:40 AM;vsh;P.S. The problem with the demo system is not caused by the searchable edit but by the refactoring of TypeOfBuildingBlock.	21/Dec/11 4:52 PM;vsh;P.P.S: http://www.iteraplan.de/iteraplan_ee_demo/ is operational again	23/Dec/11 12:20 PM;vsh;P.P.P.S. There seems to be a problem with the Dojo widgets in the demo versions, however I haven't been able to identify the cause. A demo version deployed on a local machine behaves as expected as does the Nightly Build.	04/Jan/12 2:16 PM;lci;When initializing the component model, the available elements are loaded and filtered to exclude cycles, but the drop down menu doesn't use the list (any more). 	09/Jan/12 5:20 PM;bsi;In Bulk update the set of predecessors is empty	"17/Jan/12 7:09 PM;sry;Remarks on code:
* IteratecFunctions.js, function addFilteringSelect: Please document the function parameters and what this function does, in a few words. Please use more uniquely named global objects instead of ""set"" and ""stores"". The initialization for those two should be coded and shared from one file, not three times in different files please.
* DojoUtils#write should call #canWrite on the Converter object first, and throw an IllegalArgumentException if it can't -- or use stricter type than Object in method signature...
* looking at changeset [15059], there is a lot of repetition in the implementation of add/remove IDs - I'd suggest to provide one common implementation for that which just calls an abstract getBuildingBlockService() method. Does it make sense to create another intermediate super class for ComponentModels which provide dynamic loading? Please do also have a look at changeset [15107] and adapt the simplifications from that, where possible.

remarks on UI:
* Searchable Edit should also be used in the new Business Mapping matrix edit mode. But this is probably worth a separate ticket
* minor issue: could the list elements in drop-down always be sorted alphabetically (with their hierarchical name)? As we have filtering, this is not severe but would it make look more consistent
* general question to PM: It seems somewhat inconsistent that the list of already assigned relation shows the non-hierarchical names while the drop-downs show hierarchical names. Only one variant should be used in my opinion."	23/Jan/12 11:28 AM;bsi;Refactoring is OK. The drop-down list is sorted alphabetically as well.
