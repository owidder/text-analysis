Reordering attributes in groups has no effect on rendered order on building block attribute pane	"Assume you have an attribute group with its attributes in this order: A B C. This is also the order how the attributes attributes appear on the attribute pane of a building block.

Now edit the attribute group and change the order to B C A. Refresh the building block detail page and check the attribute order there.

It should have changed as well, to reflect the changed order. However, the order remains the same. This is a follow-up on ticket ITERAPLAN-422."		Bug	iteraplan PO	06/Mar/12 6:44 PM	06/Apr/12 10:56 AM					attribute	sort								13/Mar/12 5:03 PM;sry;has been merged into 2.9.x branch, but only after 2.9.1	"21/Mar/12 6:12 PM;sry;still does not work, neither in Branch 2.9 nor in trunk. Only clearing the cache makes changes to the order visible.

The actual problems seems to be, that AttributeType objects cache their _position_ property and don't get updated when the AttributeTypeGroup is reordered. AttributeType#compareTo() uses the _position_ value."	22/Mar/12 12:33 PM;sry;Now I've implemented a solution that brings additional effort during saveOrUpdate() of AttributeTypeGroups only, but not for sorting.	12/Apr/12 12:26 PM;vsh;One known problem exits when attributes from the default group are added and then again removed from an attribute group. In this case they are automatically reassigned to the default group getting the last available position. However when a building block is opened, new the position is not accounted for and the attribute still appears at its previous position. This hints at a caching problem because it disappears once the default group has been saved after edit. Only a tedious workaround was found for this issue so it was decided against reopening the ticket (and a rare use case).
