Criteria Filtering on overview pages applies too strict date ranges and omits legitimate search results	The overview page search creates an internal query where (for projects, information systems and technical components) start data and end date are equal and =TODAY. This leads to results, where all elements ending *before* TODAY or starting *after* TODAY are omitted. For correct results, no start and end dates must be set.
