Search saved queries (spreadsheet and graphical)	"The list of saved queries can become rather lengthy, which makes it tedious to find a particular list entry. 

Thus, implement a search mechanism for the typical list of saved queries. It should perform a full-text search on names and descriptions of saved queries. The list should simply be reduced to the matching list entries.

Consider that the list of saved queries may be as long as ~500 entries, and searching should work quickly even on IE8. This may or may not rule out a pure Javascript implementation."

Takes around 5-10 minutes to filter large saved query lists, when searching for a term commonly included in the saved query names/descriptions.
Maybe someone else should test this again."	09/Apr/13 11:30 AM;sfe;works fine now	10/Apr/13 11:17 AM;sry;great, thx to all!
