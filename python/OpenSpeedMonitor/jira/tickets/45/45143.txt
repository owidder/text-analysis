* Direct properties, attributes, relations and permissions will be copied. 
* If applicable: business mappings will be copied.
* If applicable: hierarchy link to superordinated element will be copied
* If applicable: deep copy of sub-elements  / sub-specializations: requirement should be discussed in iteraplan JF before functionality is removed in trunk
* If applicable: deep copy of interfaces & transported business objects: requirement should be discussed in iteraplan JF before functionality is removed in trunk
