Initial data set should only contain the most essential roles	The initial data is still slightly too big, as it contains the sample roles (like "IT Architect" and the like). Those roles should be omitted, too, when the XMI import takes place. Effectively, only the roles _iteraplan\_Supervisor_ and _MainUser_ should be imported.
