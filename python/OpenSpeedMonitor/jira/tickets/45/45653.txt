Property "Status" should be available as additional column on Information System and Technical Component overview pages	"While description, another built-in property, can be selected (and is so per default) as column to be displayed on building block type specific overview pages, the property ""Status"" is unavailable on IS and TC pages.
It should be made available."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	26/Mar/13 8:36 AM	12/Jun/13 3:59 PM					overview	status								21/May/13 1:03 PM;tdi;Property "Status" is also not available for queries on the IS and TC pages. This would help users to filter out e.g. "retired" or "target"	07/Jun/13 10:48 AM;sfe;Since the filtering according to the status property, as mention in the comment of tdi above, is a completely different matter implementation-wise, I created a new issue for that: ITERAPLAN-1615	14/Jun/13 7:34 PM;sry;Follow-up issue in ITERAPLAN-1624 (re. other built-in properties)
