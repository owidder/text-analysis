Dashboard behaviour when changing the underlying content of a saved query used within an dashboard template	"Experienced behaviour: When changing the underlying content (= building block type) of a saved query which is used within a dashboard template, this results in a weird behaviour when a dashboard instance of the dashboard template is loaded (cf. Screenshot). I changed the ""content"" of a cluster diagram from information system to projects and saved it with the same name (and therefore identifier).

*Expected behaviour*: Dashboard is still loading and displayed (Headline, Text and working diagrams), and the - now incompatible - diagram is displayed in the exact way it has been saved as, subtitled with a warning that this diagram does not match the dashboard's building block type and thus the set of building blocks could not be replaced).

Please re-check whether any errors occur in the dashboard in this case. If not, this ticket should be closed.	11/Jul/13 12:56 PM;isc;The problem doesn't exists anymore.	15/Jul/13 10:48 AM;sry;Problem was a consequence of another bug, which has been fixed for new queries. The problem may re-arise if a user tries to use a saved query that has been corrupted in the database by a pre-3.1.0 release version.
