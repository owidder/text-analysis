Relations not all set correctly when copying a information system with sub information systems which have sub systems of their own	"If you create a information system 'parent' with the information system 'child' as sub information system and 'grandchild' as sub information system of 'child', and then create a copy 'parent copy' of parent, the result is as follows:

Along with 'parent copy' the systems 'child.2' and 'grandchild.2' are created. 'child.2' is sub information system of 'parent copy', but 'grandchild.2' is not sub system of 'child.2' nor of any other information system. It should be sub information system of 'child.2'."
