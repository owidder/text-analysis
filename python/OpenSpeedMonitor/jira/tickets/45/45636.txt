Enable masterplan diagram to reference DateIntervals for rendering bars	"Right now, the masterplan diagram can only show the hard-wired runtimePeriod information attached to IS, TC and Projects.
For lifecycle modelling, we need DateIntervals to be displayed in the masterplan diagram. (Let's assume that it should show _either_ RuntimePeriods or DateIntervals. But in the future we may need to be able to mix both)

First, focus work on the *SVG* output format. Corresponding Visio output should be implemented later on.

Requirements:
* The configuration UI should allow to select DateIntervals (or the default Runtime period, if available)
* First, render a single bar for one selected DateInterval on the calendar tableau
* Next, render more then one DateInterval within the same row
* *to be discussed*: What should be shown if two (or more) DateIntervals overlap?

Instead of the checkbox ""Include Date-Intervals"", provide dropdowns with the available date intervals and the runtime period (if available for the selcted type). It should work much like the selection of additional columns in the _advanced_ section.

In the diagram, please show the name of the date interval instead of simply _Date Interval_."	"10/Apr/13 5:57 PM;sry;Remarks on the output so far:
# Please show start and end date also as text in the corresponding columns.
# Show rows for DateIntervals always, even if there are no dates for a BB or the dates are entirely outside the shown timespan. This will give a more consistent look.
# For the DateInterval dropdown, make RuntimePeriods on IS, TC and Project behave the same as DateIntervals. That means, they can be removed from and re-added to the diagram configuration in exactly the same way as custom DateIntervals (even though they are technically very different). By default, RuntimePeriods should be selected for inclusion in the diagram, but the user must be able to remove them. If nothing is selected, the diagram should show empty lines for such BBs, i.e. no dates and no bar.
# If the currently selected type does not have any DateInterval (or RuntimePeriod) assigned that could still be added, hide the dropdown and its label. If the type has neither DateInterval nor RuntimePeriod available, hide the entire UI block ""Please choose which date intervals...""
