Check BuildingBlockUtil's clone functionality for correctness	"I've noticed that, for example, in the clone method for Information System Releases in the class BuildingBlockUtil, the parentComponents collection as well as the successor collection aren't handled, while their opposites, the baseComponents and predecessor collections are.
Please check whether this is correct or whether this could result in problems, and whether there are more places like this in the various clone methods.

Related functionality are subscription emails. Cloned building blocks are used as ""snapshots"" to determine changes to report in subscription emails."		Bug	iteraplan PO	27/Mar/13 8:57 AM	17/Oct/13 3:56 PM					3.1.1-candidate	subscriptions								05/Aug/13 1:41 PM;bra;might have been forgotten while changing the ui to also display these relationships	06/Aug/13 11:19 AM;sfe;For some reason changes in the successor relationship are still not respected in notification emails for both technical component releases and information system releases.	"06/Aug/13 3:24 PM;bra;unfortunately we have to choose between history and notification here.

If we enable notifications on the successors (see commented code in RelationDiffer#addReleaseSequenceDiffs), the history does not work anymore.

I have tracked the history issue down to a broken RelationDescription of the successor/predecessor relationship not being identified as a bidirectional relationship in the EntityInstantiator's AuditConfiguration.

Not sure if this is caused by a broken hibernate mapping in our code or by a bug in envers. An upgrade to the latest hibernate version might fix this one as well as the other history issues we currently have on the Responsibility and Enum attributes of buildingblocks."	06/Aug/13 4:47 PM;bra;notification/history issue is addressed in ITERAPLAN-1835	"16/Oct/13 5:02 PM;psc;Reviewed. If children of a watched Informationsystem are changed a notification is sent. If successors of a watched Informationsystem or a watched technical component are changed, a notification is sent as well.

I noticed, that for notification on IS, currently it seems that no matter what the actual reason for the notification was, in addition to it, changes to connected interfaces are proclaimed within the notification. I will clarify whether this issue is related to the changes within this ticket. If it is not, I will open a dedicated ticket for the described system behavior."	17/Oct/13 3:56 PM;sfe;seems fine	"17/Oct/13 4:01 PM;sry;The erroneous interface change entries haven been fixed. Ticket is ok now. Further pending issues with notifications are covered by ITERAPLAN-2018. 
While reviewing this ticket, I made a couple of refactoring. These are tracked in  ITERAPLAN-2027 and should be applied _after_ release 3.2."
