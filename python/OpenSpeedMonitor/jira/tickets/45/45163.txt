Perform post-login initialization in an ApplicationListener instead of AuthenticationSuccessHandler	"Our current post-login initialization logic is implemented in a AuthenticationSuccessHandler implementation. This works fine with form-based authentication, as Spring Security's classes come with a setter for such a AuthenticationSuccessHandler. However, pre-authentication scenarios like X.509 or J2EE authentication don not feature such setters out of the box. We had to create our own AuthencationFilter implementations again and again to integrate the AuthenticationSuccessHandler.

The preferred hook for Spring Security seems to be that you implement an [ApplicationListener|http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/api/org/springframework/context/ApplicationListener.html] for handling success events, which are consistently fired by Spring Security core classes."

It seems therefore not possible to use an ApplicationListener accordingly."	24/Jan/12 11:19 AM;sry;Something still seems to be wrong with the Community Edition authentication filter. See the NPE at https://iteraplan.iteratec.de/iteraplan_community_edition_nightly/start/start.do	25/Jan/12 2:13 PM;agu;As it turned out, it is not possible to use the ApplicationListener instead of AuthenticationSuccessHandler. So the only change was, that the classes in SpringSecurityExtensions were moved from one package to other.	25/Jan/12 7:15 PM;sry;Luca, where is the JIRA issue that you created at Spring Security? Would like to keep an eye on it.	"26/Jan/12 10:44 AM;lci;Here is the SEC ticket
