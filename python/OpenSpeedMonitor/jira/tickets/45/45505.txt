List of watched elements in Context Actions doesn't work as expected	"* After clicking on ""watch"", the subscribed element or building block doesn't appear in Context Actions as expected. Only after refresh.

* The List of watched elements in Context Actions shows only subscribed elements, but no subscribed building block types. The caption ""Watched elements"" represents the current functionality, but actually both types of subscriptions (elements and buidling block types) should be listed here.

Bug	iteraplan PO	20/Apr/12 2:39 PM	21/May/12 1:54 PM					gui	subscriptions								"30/Apr/12 9:28 AM;gph;* After clicking on ""watch"", the subscribed element or building block doesn't appear in Context Actions as expected. Only after refresh.

=> Should there be a whole site refresh after subscribing (ugly)? Ajax update would be VERY difficult with current technology.

* The List of watched elements in Context Actions shows only subscribed elements, but no subscribed building block types. The caption ""Watched elements"" represents the current functionality, but actually both types of subscriptions (elements and buidling block types) should be listed here.

=> Shall watched types really appear in this menu? In which order? Should the caption change to ""Watched elements and types""?

* If there are huge amount of subscribed elements, and you expand the ""Watched elements"" section, then the elements outside the screen can't be accessed. Scrolling not possible. (see Screenshot ""Context Actions too big.jpg"") Thanks to Bernhard (bra) for reporting.

=> What should happen? Scrollbar (like screenshot ""Context Actions with scrollbar.jpg"")? Limit display to certain amount? ...?
"	"30/Apr/12 11:16 AM;kvo;Scrollbar is fine.
Rest is ""Wontfix"", since first change is too hard for little effect and ""Watched types"" don't make too much sense"	30/Apr/12 4:17 PM;gph;Ok, just applied a scrollbar to "watched elements" section in "context actions", if more then 18 watched elements are displayed. Works in all browsers. Just IE8 is sometimes a little unstable (surprise!). Problem?	01/May/12 12:11 PM;lci;The issue is related to ITERAPLAN-689, which I reported a couple days ago. The scrollbar (maybe one could use some slimmer scrollbar layout?) works fine itself, but if there are open elements, the watched elements may become unreachable before the max number (see screenshot). While this can be again prevented by closing the open elements accordion, I think a solution adding a scrollbar taking account of both accordions ((openElementsCounter + watchedElementsCounter) < 18), or even better the size of the contextMenu itself (though some javascript-magic may be required here) would provide a better general solution.	10/May/12 10:18 AM;lci;Ok.	"16/May/12 5:23 PM;gph;In IE9, when watched elements section is expanded after loading the page, the content is displaced to the bottom of the context actions menu (screenshot ""IE damage on expand.jpg""). The header bar (which is usually shown when the table header hides on the top of the screen) displays at the wrong place, too.

The header bar looks damaged in IE9 anyway (screenshot ""IE damaged header bar.jpg""). Is this related?
"	"17/May/12 3:23 PM;lci;The mainContent-div seems to be pushed below by a div generated by the expansion, which occupies the whole page. It could be the spacer the plugin uses as placeholder for the menu. I will look further into that asap.
Regarding the header bar, I could not reproduce the problem and I have no idea how the two should interfere."	21/May/12 5:19 PM;tse;looks nice
