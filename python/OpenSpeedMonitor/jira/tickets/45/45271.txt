Landscape Diagram: NullPointerException when not using a names legend	Under certain circumstances, when there are many colors available (>8), a method to correct the position of the diagram's names legend is called, even in the case the option to use a names legend was deselected. In this case the names legend object was never initialized, so this method call results in a NullPointerException.
