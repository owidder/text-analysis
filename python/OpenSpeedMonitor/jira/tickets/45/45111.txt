Save Roles of Users to enable correct subscriptions 	"It shouldn't be possible to gain more information via subscriptions than via web-access.
Currently this is not the case, since we have no information stored which roles a user belongs to.
So with each login, we have to save all roles of a user in the DB after deleting all existing roles of a user.
Subscriptions then can use this information to check if the subscriber has the right to get emails for this building block and all attributes."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	02/Sep/11 1:55 PM	11/Oct/11 10:54 AM														02/Sep/11 3:28 PM;vsh;There is an additional problem. To realise permission checks before sending emails we need to know the permissions of all the users subscribed to the element including the ones that are not currently logged in. Two additional questions arise: How do we know the permissions for subscribed user who have been saved in our database (via Excel import) but who haven't logged in yet? What happens if a user has had permission for a certain BBT but the permission has been revoked or extended since his last login?	29/Sep/11 4:49 PM;vsh;initial version for the newest release candidate. Refactoring and improvement necessary.	04/Oct/11 10:15 AM;vsh;content flitering moved to advice, please retest.
