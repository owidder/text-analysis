Retain expand/collapse state of attribute groups in building block edit mode	"Currently, attribute groups on building block detail pages are *always collapsed* when the page is loaded. Since editing a building blocks involves frequent page reloading, this behaviour is annoying. Attribute groups need to be searched and expanded again and again.

This should be changed so that either
 * an administrator can configure whether groups are by default collapsed or expanded.
 * each building block dialog retains the expand/collapse state of each attribute group as long as the dialog is open."

The state of the different menu entries (open/closed) is saved on the server, changes are transmitted using the DWR framework.	28/Oct/11 6:02 PM;agu;nice :)	31/Oct/11 5:53 PM;fma;Could we apply the same mechanism in section "Erweiterte Einstellungen" of "Masterplangrafik" when selecting additional columns? Currently, when you select a column and use the add-Button the part of the page collapses and you don't see whether the value was added as additional column.
