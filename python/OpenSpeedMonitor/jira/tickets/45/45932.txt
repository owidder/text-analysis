UI does not respond to user actions after executing a specific command (e.g., generating a diagram visualization)	"What steps will reproduce the problem?
1. In Navigation Menu go to Visualisations -> and choose, e.g., Landscape Diagram
2. For ""content"" chose Information Systems
3. In Column association choose for example Relation:Business Processes; in Row association choose Attribute:Status
4. Choose any Output format, e.g., PDF
5. Click at ""Generate diagram"" button
6. Pop-up shows to save the file, ... , discard it.
7. Now click at ""Save query..."" button
8. Pop-up shows. Enter a name for the query
9. Click at ""Save query"" button

What is the expected output? What do you see instead?
It should hide the ""Save query"" pop-up and save the query.
But it doesn't. 
All you can do is, close the pop-up, refresh the page (or click again at Visualisations Menu) and repeat the steps 7-9 to get it to work.

Also if you try steps 5-6 twice in succession, it will not regenerate the diagram until you have refreshed the page.
