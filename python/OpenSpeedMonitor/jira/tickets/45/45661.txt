Support more than one AD domain in an efficient way	"Searching the entire domain forrest works with our standard approach to LDAP authentication, but can be very slow.
To speed up the process, implement a class similar to {{FilterBasedLdapUserSearch}} which takes more than one search base as a parameter. 

This should allow limiting the search scope to a smaller part of the LDAP tree"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	28/Mar/13 3:57 PM	26/Apr/13 5:43 PM					ldap									28/Mar/13 4:06 PM;sfe;The new class FilterBasedLdapUserSearchWithMultipleSearchBases was implemented as part of the springSecurityExtensions in the iTURM project on sourceforge.	"04/Apr/13 4:40 PM;sry;Change in Spring Security Extensions Project:
* Deprecated LdapSpringSecurityContextSource, as its convenience constructor has been added upstream. It provides no extra functionality any more.
* Improved use of a deprecated method in FilterBasedLdapUserSearchWithMultipleSearchBases
* Updated dependency to Spring Security 3.1.3"	"17/Apr/13 8:17 PM;sry;Feedback from customer: New class {{FilterBasedLdapUserSearchWithMultipleSearchBases}} works, but can be made a little more robust.
They have the situation that some of their AD domains are slow to respond and cause a timeout exception. In that case, the implementation should catch and report the exception *and* proceed to try finding the user in the next search base. Right now, it fails completely on that timeout."	22/Apr/13 4:00 PM;sfe;More robust implementation of {{FilterBasedLdapUserSearchWithMultipleSearchBases}} committed to the springsecurity extentions in the iTURM project on sourceforge.	26/Apr/13 5:44 PM;sry;Added some small improvements to comments etc. in the Spring Security Extensions project.
