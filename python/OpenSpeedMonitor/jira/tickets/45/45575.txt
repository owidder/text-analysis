Search for information systems with a minus or underscore doesn't work	"We have defined the following information systems:

* SAP-HR
* SAP-FICO

If we now search in Quick Search or Full-text search for ""SAP-HR"" or ""SAP-FICO"", no results are displayed. When searching for SAP, all items will be displayed.
The same behaviour for information systems with a underscore (e.g. SAP_HR, SAP_FICO)"		Bug	iteraplan PO	03/Sep/12 2:56 PM	17/Sep/12 7:21 PM					gui									"17/Sep/12 7:21 PM;sry;A text box with a warning appears as soon as you enter special characters like minus or underscore into a full-text search box. Such characters have special meaning for the embedded search engine and are not treated literally.

It's possible to still get the desired results if you enclose your query in quotation marks, i.e. {{""SAP-HR""}}.

iteraplan 4 is going to search with a different technology, and will treat minus etc. literally, so quotation marks won't be necessary."
