False "duplicate name" error during Excel Import	"Error appears when attempting to import an Excel file with at least two enumerations named in the following fashion:

xxx (some text in a bracket)
xxx (some other text in a bracket)

Apparently the brackets and their contents are ignored during import, resulting in the false ""duplicate name"" error due to the identical prefixes of the attribute names."
