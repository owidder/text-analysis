Spreadsheet filtering of date attributes not supported by date picker and error message displayed without an error	In spreadsheet reports filtering of date attributes (not the build in ones) is not supported by date picker (below the dropdown of available dates) and even an error message gets displayed right away without an error, or without a wrong date format being entered. The date format works and filters correctly, but error is still shown.		Bug	iteraplan PO	04/Jun/13 4:45 AM	04/Jun/13 1:08 PM
