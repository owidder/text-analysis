Relations with attributes: use attributes in export, import, visualization	"see ITERAPLAN-494:

In general, relations with attributes work fine.
The following aspects may need further consideration:

 * Multi-Value Text Attribute Types can not have more that one value assigned per Business Object in the Information System page (the same holds when editing the association through the Business Object page).
 * Associations can not be used to extends a query in e.g. the spreadsheet reports - this is not implemented yet.
 * Excel Export: The relations are exported (the Business Objects in the Information System tab in Excel), but the associations and their assigned attribute values aren't. Also, the Abstract Association building blocks do not get exported in a tab of their own.
 * Information Flow Diagram: The filtering of associations doesn't work, since it relies on the spreadsheet reports, which don't implement the feature so far. An interesting observation at this point is that the abstract business object (""-"") can be assigned to an Information System or an Interface (and is being accordingly exported in an Information Flow Diagram).
