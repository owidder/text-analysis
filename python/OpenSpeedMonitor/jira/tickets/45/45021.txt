Error page when switching back and forth between configuration steps of graphical reports, in case the query returns a high number of elements	"Suppose you created a graphical report for a very high amount of building blocks (thousands, so practically only doable with Pie/Bar charts at the moment). 
If you go from the configuration step 2 to step 1 by clicking the iteraplan back button, and then click ""confirm Selection"" before page of step 1 is loaded completely, the result sometimes is the general error page of iteraplan."		Bug	iteraplan PO	29/Jun/11 2:00 PM	08/Jul/11 4:10 PM					query	reports								"08/Jul/11 4:10 PM;kgo;Tested successfully with an Intel Core i7-2600, 4 GB RAM, with some 3800 Information Systems.

The error could be reproduced when simultaneously starting 1000 threads that overload the CPU (check if random integers are prime, each thread runs for 80 seconds). Yet, this is a situation, where Tomcat has very little of the CPU capacity. Thus, the solution should be OK for quite large data sets."
