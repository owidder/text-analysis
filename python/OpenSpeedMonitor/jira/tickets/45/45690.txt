XLSX Export: Columns are too narrow/ different from XLS	"This is a follow-up issue to ITERAPLAN-1452

Most sheets in exported XLSX have only very narrow columns, see attachment."		Bug	iteraplan PO	18/Apr/13 4:39 PM	22/May/13 8:03 PM					excel	xlsx								"19/Apr/13 8:59 AM;jme@iteratec.de;I suppose the linked ticket should be
ITERAPLAN-1492
because the attached Excel-File is a FullModelExport in Excel 2007 format.
"	"19/Apr/13 9:01 AM;jme@iteratec.de;I habve exported the model on the nightly build (19.04.2013) with IE10 and Firefox 20.0.1.
The files are attached to this ticket.
I the width of the columns seem to be ok."	19/Apr/13 9:21 AM;jme@iteratec.de;Steffen: Please provide more detailed information about the affected version, browser, environment, ...	"07/May/13 11:12 AM;jme@iteratec.de;I have reproduced the effect with a Java 7 u 21 to run the tomcat.
It vanished when I use Java 6 u 24 again."	"07/May/13 12:41 PM;jme@iteratec.de;There is a bug report addressing this behaviour:
https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=54904

Apparently this is a JDK-Bug not a poi bug.
"	07/May/13 2:25 PM;sry;Ah, very strange + interesting. Does it make sense to set the column s width explicitly, or that problematic in its own right?	"10/May/13 3:47 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Sooo ... problem solved :)

the getCellWidth-method delivers a wrong width if there is no font set explicitly (relying on the default font).
After setting the font to ""Arial"" for the header-cells the width is calculated correctly.

BtW: that was one of the differences between the Excel 2003 and Excel 2007 templates. In Excel 2003 the header-cells had Arial as font set."
