XMI import doesn't respect relations defined in the xmi file	"Example: If you export the example bank data with XMI export, then try to import that file via XMI import into a initial database, the import won't be possible due to constraint violations for InformationSystemInterfaces.
These violations happen because the necessary relations to InformationFlows of InformationSystemInterfaces aren't set. Other relations aren't set either.

This way a proper import of data from an XMI file is impossible once relationships are involved."
