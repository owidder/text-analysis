Meta Model.Time Series: When Editing an Enumeration Time Series Attribute Multiple Values Can Be Selected	Specification defines that an enumeration time series attribute cannot have multiple value selection. When editing such an attribute the checkbox to select _Multiple Values_ is available and can be checked. When attempting to save the attribute with this checkbox checked an error message is displayed (correct behavior) that explains the problem. The checkbox should grayed out, since it does not make sense in this context.
