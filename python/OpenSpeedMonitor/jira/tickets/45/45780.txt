Excel Import Time Series: Poor Error Indication on Failed Import with Future Dates	"When importing Excel data containing future dates the import fails as expected. The error information that contains the coordinates of all the cells that caused the failure is excellent and will support the customer when fixing the file.
Unfortunately, the page does not clearly indicate that the whole import failed. A red framed information on that would make it clear. Otherwise the customer might think, that just the values with the future dates were not imported."

Nice :-)	"11/Jul/13 5:13 PM;lba;Added a new colouring for the error message box, also added an extra line ""Import failed."" to indicate that the timeseries-import failed.
Currently it is not localized, i followed the example of the other import errors. 
(?) Is a localization needed?"	11/Jul/13 6:14 PM;bra;i would have expected localization, but as all the other error messages appear to not being localized i would suggest to create a separate issue for the localization	16/Jul/13 8:37 PM;sry;No localization needed, because of limited user base for that feature. Most of the time, the import will be performed in an automated fashion anyway, AFAIK.	20/Aug/13 3:44 PM;psc;Reviewed with Lars. Solution accepted.
