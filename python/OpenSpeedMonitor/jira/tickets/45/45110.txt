Visualizations tab does not offer graphics drop down on some browsers and some sites	"The Visualizations tab is almost empty in some cases (specifics yet unknown and it is hard to reproduce). As the HTML and Javascript for that tab look rather weird anyway, it should be refactored/ simplified, hoping that this random error will go away at the same time.

Altogether, this looks like a JavaScript/networking/Browser compatibility issue.

Reproduction:
 * Open an information system and switch to visualizations tab
 * The Dojo Dropdown for picking the graphics type does not appear. There is nothing except a few tables borders and headlines.

Expected:
    The Dojo dropdown as well as all other UI elements appears as usual "		Bug	iteraplan PO	02/Sep/11 8:48 PM	18/Oct/11 4:27 PM					context	graphics	javascript							06/Sep/11 12:57 PM;sry;The was an earlier ticket already, but as per Mre's tests it doesn't seem to be resolved yet.	"14/Oct/11 5:15 PM;sry;Visualizations do not show up in IE6 now. The menu is displayed fine and you can choose a graphic, but as soon as it's loaded, the whole tab becomes empty. This happens before and after my (soon committed) changes.

IE7 and IE8 do it right..."	"18/Oct/11 4:27 PM;sry;Seems to work on most systems. IE7 and IE8 gave good results, but that issue was always hard to reproduce.

I'd suggest to ship it as is and monitor what users&customers report back to us."
