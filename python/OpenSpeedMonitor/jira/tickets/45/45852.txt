Cursor on Nesting Cluster Diagram configuration page is not reset after drop of an element	"to reproduce:
# navigate to nesting cluster config page
=> when hovering over a candidate, the mouse has an _edit cursor_, but it should be a 'move' cursor
# drag n drop an outer element
=> cursor changes to 'move' on drag
=> the cursor should be changed back to 'default' after drop"		Bug	iteraplan PO	05/Jul/13 2:38 PM	15/Jul/13 9:13 AM					nesting	ui
