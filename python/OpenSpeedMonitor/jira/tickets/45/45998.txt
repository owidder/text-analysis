Spreadsheet Reports - Excel 2003: Fill sheets that exist in the template with data, whenever possible and preserve the formulas	"As an iteraplan user I want to create templates with sheets that are filled with data by the report.
I expect sheets to be filled, when they have exact the same name as sheets that are generated by the report.

This gives me the opportunity to predefine evaluations in the template, that make use of these sheets.

Note:
All data existing in a sheet, that is filled by the report can be erased beforehand.

It is vital, that any given (correct) formula in the template still work in the generated workbook."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	14/Aug/13 10:11 AM	30/Dec/15 3:17 PM					excel	reports								"14/Aug/13 10:13 AM;jme@iteratec.de;The same feature is already implemented for Excel 2007.

See: ITERAPLAN-1859"	"14/Aug/13 10:15 AM;jme@iteratec.de;Regardless how the sheet is filled (either by using the existing sheet and removing the content or by removing and recreating the sheet), in Excel 2003 the formulas are broken.

Even when the sheet is preserved, the content is not deleted and existing cells are reused."
