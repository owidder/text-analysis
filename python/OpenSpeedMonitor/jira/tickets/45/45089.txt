Error based on Corrupted Database (Hierarchy&Positions) - Enhance robustness	"In rare cases the creation of a Landscape or Bar Diagram is aborted with an iteraplan error page.
Reason is a NullPointerException related to the ""children""-List of an element containing ""null"".
While this shouldn't happen and it is unclear, how it happened, the creation routines of the diagrams could be improved to ignore such null-elements, so there could still be a diagram created."		Bug	iteraplan PO	17/Aug/11 10:28 AM	29/Aug/11 10:00 AM					eon									"23/Aug/11 10:52 AM;sfe;The error can be traced back to a corrupted database, where the POS column of hierarchical elements contains invalid data, meaning the POS numbering of all elements with a specific parent isn't consecutive. How this corruption came to pass is currently still unknown.
This also causes errors when using the UI to view and edit elements affected by this corruption, for example the mentioned parent element."	30/Aug/11 4:51 PM;sry;Oracle und MySQL repair scripts have been tested successfully.
