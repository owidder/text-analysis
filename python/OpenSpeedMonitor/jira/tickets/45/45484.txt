Saved Reports can be deleted by accident	"If you initiate the deletion of a saved report, but reconsider and attempt to cancel, the report can, under certain circumstances, still be deleted.

Example:
1. Navigate to an iteraplan page with saved queries, for example cluster diagrams.
2. Click the 'delete' button for a saved query.
3. Click 'Cancel'
4. Now try to load the saved query

=> after click on 'Ok' of the confirmation dialog for loading the query, it will be deleted instead.
Doesn't happen if you refresh the page between step 3 and 4."

Fixed it by unbinding event old handlers before binding a new Click-Event to the button.
