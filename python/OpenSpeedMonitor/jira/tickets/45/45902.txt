Column move/remove icons in extra line in BB list, various browsers and locales. 	"1) Chrome (current) Version 28.0.1500.72 m
Column ""Hierarchischer Name""
German: all three icons in second line.

Compare in English: OK, one line, English column title is shorter.


2) IE 10 (current) 10.0.9200.16635
Column ""Business Domain"" (that is name)
icons in second line.

Compare with English: same problem, name about same length


Problem is trivial for user, but not trivial to solve for multiple browsers.
