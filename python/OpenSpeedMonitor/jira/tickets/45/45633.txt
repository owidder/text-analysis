Removal of values from Enumeration or Responsibility attributes leads to error page	"Reproduce (with sample data):
1. Navigate to attribute page
2. Open and edit, for example, the Accountability attribute
3. Remove one of the values, for example ""alice""
4. save
=> error page


Create JUnit Tests for this use-case first(!), before trying to solve the problem!"		Bug	iteraplan PO	07/Mar/13 2:09 PM	02/May/13 5:15 PM					attribute	enum								"20/Mar/13 5:34 PM;gph;This bug has a relation to ITERAPLAN-573, because the ResponsibilityAV created in
UserEntityManyAssociationComponentModelResponsibilityAT.initializeFrom(ResponsibilityAT)
with id==null appear as ""duplicates"" in
ResponsibilityAttributeValuesComponentModel.dereferenceRemovedAttributeValues(ResponsibilityAT, List<ResponsibilityAV>).

This prevents deleting of attribute values, because the difference between ComponentModel and AttributeType's values can't be determined. A clean solution for both bugs must be found."	27/Mar/13 11:14 AM;gph;The same problem occurs when a (user entity) value is added to a Responsibility Attribute.	"27/Mar/13 3:32 PM;gph;There are still a few problems left:

* When na attribute value is added, the calculation of the ""difference"" between the ComponentModel's attribute values and the ""real"" attribute values is wrong:

ResponsibilityAttributeValuesComponentModel.dereferenceRemovedAttributeValues(...):
SetView<ResponsibilityAV> difference = Sets.difference(...)

This happens because of rev. #18760, where attribute values are instantiated new with null-id. Due to the equals/hashCode-implementation in AttributeValue and ResponsilibityAV, elements with different id are considered as not equal, regardless of their data ( getValue() ). There should be another way to fix the problem in ITERAPLAN-573 (copying of attribute values when an attribute is copied).

* When the ConcurrentModificationException is solved, a ConstraintViolation occurs. This happens since rev. #17459. Check the Hibernate configuration and the proper handling of associations/ mapped collections between AttributeValue, AttributeType, AttributeValueAssignment and BuildingBlock!"	16/Apr/13 4:39 PM;sfe;Issue seems only to appear if the there are building blocks with values assigned for the Responsibility attribute type in question.	"18/Apr/13 5:03 PM;sfe;Note for testers of this ticket:
Please test editing and copying of responsibility attributes thoroughly, as the implementation of the related component model was re-done."	02/May/13 4:02 PM;sry;Please remember to merge into RB_3_0 as well. Thx.	02/May/13 5:15 PM;gph;Works.
