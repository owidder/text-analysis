Full-text search results should also show name of found interfaces	"When using full-text search, the result table shows only the names of connected Information Systems of an Interface, but not the actual name of the interface.

The result table should show both the Interface name and the names of the connected Information Systems, e.g. like

Name (ISR A # 1.0 <-> ISR B # 2.5)
{noformat}"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	31/May/13 1:19 PM	30/Dec/15 2:32 PM					full-text
