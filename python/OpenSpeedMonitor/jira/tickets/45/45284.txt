XMI Export lacks values of date attributes	"The output file of an XMI export does not contain the values of date attributes.
For reproduction, create a date attribute type, edit one building block to assign a value for that date attribute, and create an XMI export.
The exported file will only contain a line like the following, i.e. it lacks the actual date.
{code}
  <content xsi:type=""attribute:DateAV"" id=""DateAV_371"" olVersion=""0"" attributeType=""DateAT_270""/>
{code}

When such a file is reimported, the date value column is set to null, which causes a number of other problems subsequently."

A constraint should be added to at least assure some kind of fail-fast behaviour.	12/Dec/11 2:25 PM;bsi;OK
