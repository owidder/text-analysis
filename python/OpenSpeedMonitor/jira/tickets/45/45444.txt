XMI Import: Saved bar/pie chart definitions loose some of their configured attributes	"I moved some data around as an XMI file. After importing the data again (see Build-ID below), some composite bar/pie charts had lost a couple of their configured attributes, i.e. less bars were shown than in the original installation.

My speculation is that this is related to the attribute ID re-adjustment logic during XMI import. No further analysis has been caried out yet.

Access to original data and XMI file can be requested from me :)"		Bug	iteraplan PO	29/Mar/12 4:47 PM	01/Jul/14 2:20 PM					bar	import	pie	xmi						25/Jun/14 4:51 PM;fka;Is this still applicable?	"01/Jul/14 2:20 PM;gph;Too many open questions:
* Old or new XMI-Export/-Import?
* What means ""moved around data""?
* What exactly happened to the bar chart?
* Which ""original data"" has been used?

Couldn't reproduce with the provided information."
