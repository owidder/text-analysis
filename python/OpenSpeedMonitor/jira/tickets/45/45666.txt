Make sure that all settings in iteraplan.properties can be overridden by iteraplan_local.properties	"We have an override mechanism for settings {{iteraplan.properties}}, but it does not work for all settings in that file. Effectiveness depends on how that value is retrieved: either directly in Spring configuration, or programmatically via class {{IteraplanProperties}}. The latter mechanism allows overriding settings in {{iteraplan_local.properties}}, the former not.

Adapt the Spring configuration in such a way that we can apply configuration overrides in {{iteraplan_local.properties}} for Spring-configured settings as well.

This override mechanism is very useful for customer-specific customizations."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	04/Apr/13 4:28 PM	10/May/13 12:08 PM					configuration	maintenance	spring							"08/Apr/13 1:30 PM;sry;It might be enough to add {{iteraplan_local.properties}} to the propertyConfigurer bean like this
{code}
	<bean id=""propertyConfigurer""

		<property name=""locations"">
			<list>

				<value>classpath*:iteraplan-global.properties</value>

This idea is not verified, though, so please test it.
One point where I can remember that settings were not overridden are email notification settings."	"23/Apr/13 1:21 PM;lba;The iteraplan.properties sometimes don't seem to be overwritten, because the jsp loads the properties directly from the iteraplan.properties file (and not from the iteraplan_local.proeprties):

{code:xml}
<fmt:bundle basename=""iteraplan"">
	<fmt:message key=""build.id"" />
</fmt:bundle>
{code}"	23/Apr/13 2:16 PM;lba;It shouldn't make any difference if iteraql is enabled or not, because the property is never used.	23/Apr/13 3:08 PM;sry;Then please remove the unused iteraQl property. Pls check the documentation and make sure that it is not treated as _optional_ any longer.	"23/Apr/13 5:04 PM;lba;Checked the iteraplan 3 documentation for apperances of iteraql.enabled and enable iteraql, there shouldn't be any.
"	26/Apr/13 4:29 PM;sfe;looks fine	26/Apr/13 6:41 PM;sry;Right, that hack in JSP files is ugly and still defeats the override intention. I found a nicer solution in [this comment|http://j2eecookbook.blogspot.com/2007/07/accessing-properties-loaded-via-spring.html?showComment=1337896817711#c7987929464142104907] on a blog post. We have Spring 3 in place, so it shouldn't be hard to integrate whereever that {{<fmt:bundle basename="iteraplan">}} stuff is used now.	"07/May/13 12:42 AM;sry;Something seems to be broken in Nightly Build, as the Build ID is not displayed properly. It shows only {{@BUILD.ID@}}

After some research I found that the timeseries customization's {{iteraplan_local.properties}} is way too verbose, as it actually contains the complete iteraplan.properties.template. I suppose it can be reduced to this essential block.

Please check any other customizations as well, whether the override settings are reduced to a minimum and do not duplicate default settings."
