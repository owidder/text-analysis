Nesting Cluster Diagram: improve robustness	"To improve:

 * Escaping: At the moment you cannot create Nesting Cluster diagrams with elements containing umlauts or other special characters in their names, as the result is a malformed document.
 * Selecting BusinessMappings for outer or inner the element types results in an error page when creating the diagram: NullPointerException because BusinessMappings don't have a ""name"". Should they even be selectable here?"
