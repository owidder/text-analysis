Full-text search strange results	"Full-text search delivers strange results.
Searching for ""13"" gives back OracleDB but without any visible reason (also missing ""found in"").
See attached Screenshot.
Additionally it was not possible to search for ""suse"" or ""SUSE"" and get back the TechnicalComponent ""Linux# SUSE Linux"".
Created the search indexes just before, and rest of results is ok -> please clarify"		Bug	iteraplan PO	03/May/12 6:31 PM	05/Jul/12 11:39 PM					full-text	search								05/Jul/12 11:39 PM;kvo;cannot reproduce with new search
