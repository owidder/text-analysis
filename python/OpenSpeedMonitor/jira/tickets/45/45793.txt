A User might be displayed the name of an attributetype even if he does not have the permission to configure attributetypes	"If a user (by knowing/guessing the url) navigates to the detail page of an attributetype he is presented the 'You are not entitled to access this page.' message.
However, in the context menu the attributetype is displayed as an open element and therefore the name of the attributetype is presented to the user although he might not be allowed to even see the name

Rating WFR:
minor security issue. More important that visibility of metamodel is visibility of data

Recommendation WFR:
put an inconspicuous note into the docs (e.g. ""the names of attributetypes may be presented to an unauthorized user"")"		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/Jun/13 1:12 PM	25/Jun/13 2:55 PM					security									"25/Jun/13 1:15 PM;bra;same happens for buildingblocks and users.
there might be more places where this is happening"	"25/Jun/13 2:55 PM;sry;Thx for identifying and reporting this issue.

Though, we won't fix it beyond documentation, as it is a very minor problem, as almost no relevant data can leak."
