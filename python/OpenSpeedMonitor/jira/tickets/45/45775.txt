color legend entries size exceeds color legend box when using "color values from a range"	"see screenshot

to reproduce:
# configure a portfolio diagram use values from a range for the configuration of the color
# generate the diagram
=> color legend is broken

this also happens, although a bit different, for the landscape diagram. i did not check other diagrams but their legends may be broken too."		Bug	iteraplan PO	20/Jun/13 1:29 PM	30/Dec/15 2:53 PM					color	legend
