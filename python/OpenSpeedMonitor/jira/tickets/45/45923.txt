XMI export can not handle some special characters	"Example: A customer could not download the XMI&Ecore bundle from the mass data page of iteraplan. The error message (in IE8) said the file could not be downloaded.
The error happend in the emf.ecore conversion and the reason was ""Caused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: An invalid XML character (Unicode: 0xb) was found..."".
That character was part of the description of an enumeration value.

Our XMI export apparently can't handle certain special characters, especially control characters.
There should be either a meaningful error message when an export containing elements with such characters is attempted, or some sort of escaping should be applied."		Bug	iteraplan PO	24/Jul/13 4:42 PM	01/Jul/14 12:51 PM					character	xmi								25/Jul/13 8:39 AM;tdi;Related issue: when the user clicks on export button, but cancels the download dialog and then clicks on the export button again, there is a general error and the download does not start. Again clicking on export results in correct output.	25/Jun/14 4:24 PM;fka;Is this still applicable?	"27/Jun/14 12:50 PM;dop;At first, related to the issue that [~tdi] reported in his comment, I can't reproduce that (IE 11). 

To the main issue: The above reported error message will appear, if the XML document is *not* valid and contains some special unicode character. In this case, the character 0xB is a Vertical Tab. I can't image, how that character got into the database. I have tried to insert it in textboxes in the iteraplan webui and with the excel import. In these two cases, it is not possible to insert this character. 

Then I have inserted the char in the XML zip and uploaded it. Iteraplan has crashed with the following (in my opinion appropriate) error message:

{noformat}
An error occurred while processing your request.

The file to import is corrupt and could not be read.
{noformat}

Further information about valid and invalid characters in XML files can be found here (Section 2.2): http://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/

Is there any need to care about this?"	"30/Jun/14 2:11 PM;dop;I've updated the documentation and added the section, which describes the allowed and restricted unicode characters.
