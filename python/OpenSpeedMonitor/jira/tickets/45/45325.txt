Make syntax requirements in Excel Import easy to understand and less strict	"The Excel import requires a certain structure and syntax in some field to discover the semantics correctly. Example: Stating an object hierarchy requires that levels are separated by colons. Right now, it is not enough that there is a colon, but it must also be surrounded by spaces, even though there are not syntactical reasons for this requirement.

Most probably, the situation for release separators, enumeration separators etc. is very similar. The importer should be reviewed where it imposes unnecessarily strict requirements on syntax, and it should be relaxed. Documentation and Excel templates should be updated accordingly."
