Ecore import can't handle string values where the first character was escaped during export	"When you, for example, do an ecore export of an iteraplan metamodel containing an enumeration with the literal ""\-hello\-"", the ""-"" will be escaped, so the value is represented in the ecore file as follows: ""\_xy\_hello\_xy\_"" where ""xy"" is a number dependant on the escaped character.
The xmi import is not able to read an ecore file containing entries like that, where the first character is an escaped one, and will show a kind of misleading exception message (a NumberFormatException) on the import page."
