Spreadsheet reports: Use field "suitable for interfaces" in filter criteria and as optional spreadsheet column	"If you choose technical components for spreadsheet reporting, there is no filter option for the built-in attribute ""suitable for interfaces"". You can't add it as a report column either.

That field should be made available as a filter criterion and as a report column choice."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	26/Oct/11 9:12 AM	07/Nov/11 9:32 AM					reports	spreadsheet	technicalComponent							07/Nov/11 9:32 AM;vsh;It works for me.
