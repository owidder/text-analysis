Fix envers issues with successors/predecessors relationship notifications of ISR and TCR	"As stated in ITERAPLAN-1609 there is an issue when using envers for notifications and auditing on the successors of ISR and TCR.

Investigate if there is a possibility to work around this issue.

Reactivate Successors Diffs (RelationDiffer#addReleaseSequenceDiffs) if successfully worked around the issue."

further actions:
* investigating if we could change the hibernate mappings to make the successors retrieval work with envers
* investigating if hibernate4 solves issues on the history of enum/responsibility attributes"	08/Aug/13 9:09 AM;bra;predecessors/successors relationship could be fixed for envers by changing the order to first declare the predecessors and afterwards the successors relationship. Somehow envers fails to detect the relationships as being one bidirectional instead of two unidirectional if we first declare the inverse relationship	"20/Aug/13 1:37 PM;lba;Works fine, only enumerations make trouble but that problem should be solved in another ticket
"	20/Aug/13 3:37 PM;bra;ITERAPLAN-701 addresses the issue regarding enum/responsibility attributes	"10/Oct/13 3:18 PM;psc;Reviewed with Bernhard. Fix is working.
Ticket will be closed."
