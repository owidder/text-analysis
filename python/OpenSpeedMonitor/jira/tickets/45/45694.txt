Excel Import/Export at the same time 'crashes' iteraplan	"To Reproduce:
-Upload an iteraplanExcel-2007-export
-Download an iteraplanExcel 2003 Template
(sometimes it doesn t work on the first try)

The result is, that the UI is ""stuck"" and the page is loading non stop. After some time i also recieved an OutOfMemoryException.
Maybe some kind of blocking/progress message can help, so that you won't be able to press any buttons while the upload is in progress.
Please test also the behaivour with an iteraplanExcel-2003-export upload. (Won't be that necessary if there is an blocking event.)"

In 20+ attempts, varying the order of upload/download buttons clicked, the action clicked first always was the one which was executed, while the other action apparently was ignored.
