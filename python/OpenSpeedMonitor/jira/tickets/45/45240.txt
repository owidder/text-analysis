Page number not reset after reload	"1) Create more than 20 attributes (e.g. through Excel import)
2) Open the attribute page
3) Navigate to page number 2
4) Click on the Attributes entry in the menu to the left

The initial attribute page is displayed but the page number is still 2, the range of the attributes displayed and the navigation buttons are wrong too."
