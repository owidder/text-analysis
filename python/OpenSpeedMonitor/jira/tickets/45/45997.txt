building blocks (IS) are not grouped properly in landscape diagram	"Creating a landscape diagram with the settings (see img ""settings.png"") creates a diagram that stacks many instances of the same builing block. This becomes a problem when ""Span content elements between neighbouring cells"" is selected (see img ""spanning.png"").

In case of the mapping (BP: Purchasing, BU: XY, IS: SAP ERP # ECC 6.04) there are only two different business mappings in the model (see img ""businessMappings.png"")
The IS SAP ERP # ECC 6.04 has nine direct sub IS an a total of 13.

If the sub systems are filered out before diagram generation the result is fine (see img ""SpanningOnlyTopLevel.png"") but there are still two elements stacked.

mre: The issue seems to be related with hierarchies... (SnipImage.JPG)"		Bug	iteraplan PO	14/Aug/13 9:20 AM	13/Jan/14 11:09 AM					visualization									08/Jan/14 3:16 PM;fka;Please analyse first to find out, what exactly goes wrong here	"10/Jan/14 9:22 AM;bra;seems to be related with the strict mode. If there are two different businessmappings for the same is, bu and bp but with different prod a content rectangle is created for each of them if the strict mode is enabled. regardless of the spanning configuration.
if strict mode is disabled, only one content rectangle is created for the two businessmappings.
spanning may cause only one of the two content elements to be spanned into neighbouring cells. the second content element keeps its original size, which causes a smaller content element being placed at the same position as the spanned element."	"10/Jan/14 10:35 AM;bra;places where this might be fixed:
* LandscapeDiagramCreator#buildContentToAxesMappings(): in the case of config.isStrictRelations(), do not add all BMs, but only those that are distinguishable with regards to the column and row type
* LandscapeDiagramCreator#createLogicalContentMap(): ensure, entries for each cell are unique (use set instead of list within the hashbucketmatrix?)
* LandscapeDiagramCreator#buildContentElements(): only create ContentElements that are unique within the cell"	10/Jan/14 11:32 AM;fka;Decision together with Demand Management: Also in strict mode only one element should be created and subsequently drawn on the diagram. First option / place is preferred for fixing this.	10/Jan/14 4:25 PM;bra;first solution would cause some overhead and behavioral equivalence in all configuration combinations is not easily ensured. Therefore the less invasive solution 2 is preferred. (FKA agreed)	10/Jan/14 4:29 PM;bra;implementation explicitly checks if the content bb to add to the logical content map already exists. Changing the HashBucketMatrix to use sets internally is discouraged because it might have sideeffects.	17/Jan/14 2:44 PM;fka;Reviewed and ticket closed.
