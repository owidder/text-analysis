Error in cluster diagram while switching from building blocks to attributes	"The following steps result in an unexpected error:
# switch to cluster diagrams
# select ""Building Blocks"" as clustering criterion
# select ""Information Systems"" as the element to be used for clustering
# filter for information systems in with all possible status values (current, plan, ...) and empty the productive-dates; the result set should contain more than 50 elements, i.e. more than allowed
# select ""Attributes"" as clustering criterion
# select ""Accountability"" as the attribute to be used for clustering
# press ""Confirm selection""

*Expected behavior*: the visible values for Accountability are taken as the selection for configuration of the cluster diagram

*Actual behavior*: an error message ""Too many entities to display (amount: 52) Currently no more than 50 entities are allowed"" is shown (see attachement).

A similar error might occure for other diagram types as well - this hasn't been tested.
