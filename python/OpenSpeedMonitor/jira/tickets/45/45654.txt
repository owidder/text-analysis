Usage relation in InfrastructureElements	"As an IT focussed Enterprise Architect I want to model different dependecies between InfrastructureElements.
E.g. a HW-Cluster as well as a Virtual Cluster
The strict hierarchy is not sufficient, but an additional usage relation (similar to InformationSystems) would help.

Check list of functionality to be adapted:
* Data model (Hibernate mapping), SQL scripts
* EA Data details view in read and edit mode, and documentation
* Spreadsheet reports query forms (and thus implicitly all report query forms)
* bulk update
* start screen meta-model diagram
* elastic Model reader and writer
** iteraQl support, and corresponding documentation
** Excel export
** Excel import
** Visualization in nesting cluster diagrams??
* Cluster diagram
* Pie charts
* email notifications
* history changeset presentation; SQL migration script for history tables

The related functionality (Excel import/export, iteraQL, nesting cluster diagram) works without further changes as well.
Documentation of iteraQL already handles the usage relationship on a general basis (meaning it is not especially mentioned for each building block type supporting this relation), and since the usage relation of Infrastructure Elements follows the same syntax, I don't see the need to extend the documentation."	16/Jul/13 9:01 PM;sry;Very well done!
