Installer does never terminate initializing the database	"If you run the Installer and ask it to initialize the database, the routine for generating the initial data does never terminate. The tables and the initial data are all create fine, but the Ant task hangs.

This is probably a side-effect of the Hibernate update recently, as the JVM has some Hibernate Search threads hanging around. Those threads prevent proper termination of the JVM."
