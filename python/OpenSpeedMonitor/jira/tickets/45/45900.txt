Make Visio diagrams and templates compatible with Visio 2003 again	"The Visio templates (*.vdx) contain namespaces of Visio 2006 and Visio 2010. Hence the generated diagrams can't be viewed in Visio 2003.

Possible ""solution"":
* Save as binary *.vds with Visio 2010.
* Open this binary with Visio 2003 and save as *.vdx with Visio 2003 again.
