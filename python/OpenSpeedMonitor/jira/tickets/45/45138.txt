Different behaviour between Visio and SVG-based export of the Information Flow Diagram	"If you create an Information Flow Diagram with, for example, an Information System and two subordinated Information Systems selected, the superordinated system is shown as 'container' around the subordinated ones. If you now deselect the superordinated system and create the diagram, the Visio-Export still shows the 'container'-system, while the SVG-based export shows the sub-systems separately without their superordinated one.
The behaviour in this case should probably be the same for both cases."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	13/Sep/11 2:42 PM	30/Dec/15 2:32 PM					informationflow
