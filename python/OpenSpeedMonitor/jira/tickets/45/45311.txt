Filtering Interfaces in InformationFlow Diagram	"To omit cluttering of InformationFlow diagrams with interfaces that might not be of interest it should be possible to filter Interfaces.
Same filtering as in Spreadsheet reports.
"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	21/Dec/11 12:07 PM	06/Feb/12 11:52 AM					diagram									"09/Jan/12 3:32 PM;bsi;A saved query loads the whole set of interfaces instead of the interfaces that has been filtered/selected before saving the query.

Repro:

1. Filter interfaces
2. Save query
3. Load query

Result:

all interfaces are selected instead of the interfaces that were previously filtered/selected"	13/Jan/12 2:55 PM;vsh;Won't it be better to apply the filter to only the interfaces between the selected information systems and not to all available interfaces?	13/Jan/12 3:02 PM;kvo;Yes, that would be better.	"13/Jan/12 5:46 PM;sry;Suggestions for improving usability:
* Move the ""filter interfaces"" page fragment right below the list of selected information systems (above colour selection)
* It should be an expandable area just like the select IS part is now. By defaul, it should list all interfaces between the currently selected information systems, including the interface name (if there is one)
* Within that expandable area, the button for filtering the interfaces should be positioned. At the current position under Advanced Settings it's very easily overlooked.
* The filter mechanism should only return such interfaces where both ends are selected IS for the diagram. Any other interfaces won't be displayed anyway."	23/Jan/12 6:06 PM;sfe;Doing some clean-up and refactoring	06/Feb/12 11:52 AM;bsi;OK.
