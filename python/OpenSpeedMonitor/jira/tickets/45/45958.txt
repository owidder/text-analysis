Canceled Excel Import: Memory consumption should be optimized	"When hitting the cancel-button during an excel import the memory used by the import process is not freed instantly.

There is a timeout defined (currently three days) after that the memory is released. The cleanup only takes place if s.o. starts a new import process.


The memory should be freed instantly when the cancel button is pressed.
The behaviour with the timeout should stay in place in case s.o. initiates an import and discontinues the process."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	05/Aug/13 11:36 PM	14/Aug/13 8:58 AM					excel	import								"05/Aug/13 11:39 PM;jme@iteratec.de;The importWorkflow now has a step ""removeCurrentImport"":
cancel -> removeCurrentImport -> start

It is called when the import process is canceled (due to user decision or an error in the import file).

Veryfied the memory usage improvement with the Eclipse Memory Analyser."	05/Aug/13 11:40 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Verified that the memory consumption is stable even after a bunch of successfull imports.	"05/Aug/13 11:43 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Open question: should the imports only be cleaned up when a new import process is started? Or is there a better place to check the timeout of the import processes.
