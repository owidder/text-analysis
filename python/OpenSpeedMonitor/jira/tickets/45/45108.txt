Bulk updates: Permissions for building block types not accounted for correctly	The dropdown-list for building block type selection on the bulk updates page always shows all building block types to choose from, even those the user doesn't have permissions to view. If a type like that, without view-permission, is chosen, the wrong form for attributes/properties/relations selection is displayed and any query you submit returns a list of information system releases (even if you don't have the permission to view information system releases).
