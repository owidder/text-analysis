Excel Import - the matching of imported interfaces with the existing interfaces is wrong	"When I import an excel file there are some strange effects on the interfaces without BO:

1. The interface direction may be interchanged with another interface
2. An interface might be related to a different set of endpoints
3. The changes identified in the import process are not plausible"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	21/May/13 4:20 PM	20/Jun/13 11:20 AM					excel	import								"21/May/13 4:23 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Interfaces without attached BO have in the Excel sheet ""InformationFlow"" no id.
During the import the matching is done based on the id. 

So a missmatch of interfaces is inevitably."	"28/May/13 12:30 AM;jme@iteratec.de;Thats funny: in the IDCOMPARATOR that is used to do the matching one can read:
  /**
   * Compares the universal model expressions based on their IDs. If null-values occur both left and right side of the comparison,
   * you should really think of using a different comparator!
   */"	"28/May/13 12:36 AM;jme@iteratec.de;All ""virtual"" information flows (that means all interfaces that do not transport any business object) have now a derived id:
it is the negatve id of the interface, attached to the information flow.

All ""non-virtual"" or ""persistent"" information flows are left unchanged. Their id is taken from the transport-table in the static model.

The derived id is reproducable and unique. This allows us to match the building blocks exactly."	"30/May/13 1:04 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Unit-Testing:
testWorkbookRoundtrip:

 - extended the test-data set by an architectural domain and added some technical components to the domain.
 - added different directions in information flows and interfaces."
