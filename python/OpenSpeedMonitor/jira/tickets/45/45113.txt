Make Business Mapping more robust	"There are still bugs in connection with the Business Mappings. The invalid BM are saved and then GUI cannot open the BB, contained in this BM. So add the following improvements to make BM more robust:
 * Add EventListener to validate the BM after update or insert. We could do this for all Building Blocks. The overhead in most cases is minimal.
 * Update CM so, that the invalid BM could be shown. The null elements should be replaced with root elements"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	31/Aug/11 5:41 PM	02/Sep/11 1:35 PM					business	hibernate	mapping							"01/Sep/11 4:47 PM;agu;* Updated ComponentModel so, that the invalid BM could be shown.

* Unfortunately I had to remove the BuildingBlockValidatorListener, since in some situation the listener is called before the Hibernate cascade operations will be performed. This prevents for example the removing of the Business Mappings"
