Dashboard diagram attributes displayed in drop-downs improvement	"  The start dashboard page (with projects on first drop-down) has for the second drop-down a dashed line. When business applications are chosen from the first drop-down and after that projects, only then appear the corresponding attributes for the chosen type (projects).
  Moreover when a graphic is not displayed due to the fact that no values were assigned for the chosen attribute type for the selected building block type, no message is displayed for providing the user with some information.

   * info message when no attributes exist for the selected building clock type"	"06/Jul/11 4:07 PM;sry; * There is a rendering issue in IE7 (and IE6 for that matter). The bar chart is shifted to the right and parts of it are hidden. See attached screenshot.
 * In IE7, nothing happens when I choose an attribute type for any building block type. A JavaScript error is logged.
 * Please add some visual feedback for those cases where no pie chart can be shown, because there is no data available for the selected attribute type.
 * I'd be happy if we could get rid of the big white block when the page is loaded initially. The space should only be used if there is actually a pie chart to display. Shouldn't be too difficult to insert that <div> block on the fly."	13/Jul/11 10:17 AM;sry;A genuine IE7 does not render the dashboard diagrams. In IE8's emulation it works, however.	13/Jul/11 10:40 AM;sry;everything else is fine, it even works in IE6.	13/Jul/11 1:41 PM;sry;Rechecked with IE7: Diagrams are shown when I put the iteraplan URL into an Internet Zone with higher privileges (Trusted Sites). So it seems to be only a question of IE configuration and is no iteraplan problem.	13/Jul/11 1:54 PM;sry;Works the same on all browsers now.
