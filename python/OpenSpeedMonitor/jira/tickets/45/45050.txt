Copy ISRs and TCRs in one step	At the moment, copying ISRs and TCRs is different from copying any other building block type. Both *Copy* and *New Release* should be changed to work like copy of other building blocks. That is, the extra step with checkboxes should be removed, and you should directly jump to an edit-mode dialog where all the values have been filled out.
