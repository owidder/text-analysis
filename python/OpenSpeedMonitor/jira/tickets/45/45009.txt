It's not possible to subscribe to building blocks whose building block type one is subscribed to already	"If you, for example, subscribe to the building block type Information Systems, then try to subscribe to a single Information System Release, a message-box with the message ""Error"" appears, and the log shows a NonUniqueObjectException: a different object with the same identifier value was already associated with the session: [de.iteratec.iteraplan.model.user.User#9]

Possible workaround is to unsubscribe from the building block type, then subscribe to the building blocks and afterwards re-subscribe to the building block type again."

But after the subscription of a single building block and reloading of the building block page (for example by visiting another flow, then coming back, or simply hitting the browser's refresh button) the subscribing user isn't shown in the ""Show subscribers""-list. It appears there only after clicking ""refresh"" or closing and reopening the flow of the according building block.
See ITERAPLAN-124"	30/Jun/11 4:46 PM;kgo;Indeed, currently the subscription mechanism seems to function as far as the issue covered here is concerned.
