Hotkeys and shortcuts	After the most UI changes are finished, please check all buttons and hotkeys/shortcuts if they are correctly shown and functioning.		Improvement	iteraplan PO	08/Mar/12 1:28 PM	15/Mar/12 9:38 AM														"09/Mar/12 11:06 AM;kvo;The ""Shift""-Icon is missing in the hover showing the hotkeys.
Check if hotkeys are working for edit/new/... within the new transactionbar. Should be same hotkeys as in iteraplan 2.9 available"	09/Mar/12 1:02 PM;gph;Added css class for tooltips and changed image url to new ui. Hotkeys are defined in /iteraplan/WebContent/javascript/javascript.js.jsp. Haven't found out yet, why the hotkeys/tooltips don't work anymore in new ui.	14/Mar/12 10:39 AM;gph;Nothing more to do at the moment.	15/Mar/12 9:38 AM;kvo;pa√üt
