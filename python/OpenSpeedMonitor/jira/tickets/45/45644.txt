- -In Bulk update mode, after clicking _Run bulk update_ I cannot confirm the Are-you-sure-dialog by pressing the Enter key. Most other confirmation dialogs in iteraplan allow that.- Cannot reproduce, must have been a spurious effect.

The Enter button didn't confirm the Bulk update:
OS: Windows 7
Browser: Firefox 21.0

I did nothing special in the bulk update:
- select BB
- select Attribute to change
- edit values-
- -->Run Bulk update
- Tried to confirm with Enter-key, tried some tabbing to get focus on the Ok Button (i got focus, but i couldn't confirm the dialog)"	09/Jul/13 12:12 PM;bra;hmm... this looks like some of the edit actions did some javascript focussing which might prevent the right element to get focus on the modal...	09/Jul/13 2:00 PM;sry;please investigate the Enter-does-not-confirm problem further. Thx!	10/Jul/13 1:13 PM;bra;caused by invalid javascript for number validation in massupdates. this causes the onEnterClickClose javascript to not be executed...	"10/Jul/13 2:47 PM;bra;to reproduce:
# select a number AT for massupdate
=> javascript exception is thrown on the second page of the massupdate configuration"	11/Jul/13 3:22 PM;lba; - In Bulk update mode, after clicking Run bulk update I cannot confirm the Are-you-sure-dialog by pressing the Enter key.
