Bug	iteraplan PO	19/Apr/12 10:44 AM	15/May/12 12:26 PM					gui									24/Apr/12 10:17 AM;lci;Some problems (e.g. with accordion headers) persist.	26/Apr/12 11:57 AM;vsh;Problem was caused by overflow:hidden in collapse class.	"26/Apr/12 12:51 PM;lci;Works fine now. 
Keep this solution in mind, should some other UI-elements interfere with the color picker"	26/Apr/12 2:06 PM;kvo;maybe a more broad solution can be found in ITERAPLAN-658	15/May/12 12:26 PM;lci;Ok.
