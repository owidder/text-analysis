Subscriptions - status changes are not always reflected correctly	"iteraplan sends a wrongly ""no changes"" notification e-mail for a changed status from ""being decommisioned"" to ""in operation"".

TODO: retest first.

Original description below:
----
Change the status of an information system from ""being decomissioned"" to ""in operation"" (customer E-104 wording; translation: from ""au√üer Betrieb"" to ""ist""). In the mail, it says: 
No changes.

When the status is changed from ""in operation"" to ""in development"" (translation: from ""ist"" to ""plan"") this change is shown in the mail.

Shouldn't every status change be reported?
