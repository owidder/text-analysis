This was the case in 2.9 - done, thx. gph	"02/Apr/12 5:58 PM;kvo;* ToolTip on SearchPage is missing; was there before, lost in migration :( - done
* On VisualisationTab - show selected Visualisation-Name with displaying diagram (maybe next to Preview) -lci (done)

"	03/Apr/12 9:36 AM;lci;Confirming modal dialogs works fine, looked at it with Steffen, the problem couldn't be reproduced. Sometimes user iteraction may prevent the JavaScript from loading and adding the onkey event.	04/Apr/12 3:32 PM;sry;The "Information System connected to Business Objects" table seems to be misaligned. There are bogus empty cells between name and description. See attached screenshot, made with our sample data. (done)	04/Apr/12 3:34 PM;sry;I've added orange line to highlight the column misalignment. Other types of ManyAssociationSetViews seems to be affected as well, not only ISR-2-BO	"04/Apr/12 4:00 PM;kvo;* ""57 Informationssysteme gefundene"" bitte ändern zu ""57 Informationssysteme gefunden"" -gph (solved)
* 1024*768: Design. Hier noch einen unschöne Ansicht hinbekommen (zuvor neue Spalten in der Listenansicht hinzugefügt) -> siehe Anhang - done!"	05/Apr/12 11:45 AM;kvo;Remove "Relation between technical component and infrastructure element" from dropdown in Attribut-Edit under "activated for the following Building Block Types" -Done	12/Apr/12 10:55 AM;sry;Is it possible to include the top-left iteraplan by means of CSS, instead of using a hard-coded URL in an <img> tag in standard.jsp? This would make UI customizing by users easier, as CSS can be overridden. (done)	12/Apr/12 12:00 PM;sry;Re #16268: In ve2.9, there were also info-bubbles in search field on each building block type overview page. Each bubble explained what characters are accepted and that special characters can cause problems. Should we re-enable those as well? - isc (done)	15/Apr/12 1:39 PM;kvo;Breadcrumb menu can be removed on startpage (done)	"18/Apr/12 12:44 PM;isc;As far as everything works.

But there is one more thing in the “visualisationTab”
Displayed diagrams are bigger than the presentation area. (see Figure 3)
"	20/Apr/12 2:23 PM;lci;Fitting the generated images in the table isn't a trivial task for Chrome (needs a fix width which wouldn't be responsive) and IE (overflow attribute buggy), so it should be looked into after 3.0 is built (maybe separated ticket?)	20/Apr/12 4:02 PM;vsh;Instead of using overflow, use overflow-x and overflow-y in combination with max-width and max-height, then it works in Chrome too ;-)	20/Apr/12 4:15 PM;vsh;Maybe a new tickets, because not a single solution works consistently across all browsers.	20/Apr/12 4:19 PM;vsh;see ITERAPLAN-682	22/Apr/12 7:32 PM;kvo;thx to all for the great work!
