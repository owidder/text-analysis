Nesting Cluster-Diagram: The initializing of the Candidates takes too long	"When I click on Nesting Cluster-Diagram, the page is loaded and the candidates list is empty. This is all correct. But I don't see, that the candidates are loading. If in the mean time I change the color (on IE), I become a genereal error page. 
I see here following problems:
 * The performance for large data sets is inacceptable
 * The user doesn't know, that the candidates are loading. We could show loading status and disable all elements on page.
 * be more robust and don't let changing colors result in error
 * When trying to create a diagram by clicking ""generate"" before the page is loaded, exceptions and error pages can happen. Maybe disable the ""generate"" button during the loading process."
