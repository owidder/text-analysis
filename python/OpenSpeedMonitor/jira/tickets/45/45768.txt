All Built-in properties should be available as additional column on overview pages	"Follow-up on ITERAPLAN-1485.

On building block overview pages, you can only add columns for some of the built-in properties.
Columns for following properties should be add-able as well (they are available in Spreadsheets reports already...):
* Last modified by [user] (if activated in iteraplan.properties)
* Last modified on [date/ time] (if activated in iteraplan.properties)
* runtime period (where applicable)
* Seal state (for IS)

Ideas which require deeper consideration:
* self-relations
* other relations (which aren't available in Spreadsheet reports either)"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	14/Jun/13 7:34 PM	30/Dec/15 2:53 PM					consistency	overview	usability
