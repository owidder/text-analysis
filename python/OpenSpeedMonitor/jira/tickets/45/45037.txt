Portfolio Diagram: scaling (local context) not always working	"Example with our bank data:

Create a portfolio report for all information systems, assigning the ""Costs"" attribute to one of the axes. With ""no scaling (global context)"" selected, the according axis will be labeled from 0 to 1000000, because a project has that value in its Costs attribute and the global context is calculated from all values for a given attribute, across all building block types that attribute is activated for. The information systems, which all have Costs values below 10000, are placed at the border of the diagram, accordingly.
If you now select ""scaling (local context)"" at the advanced settings of the portfolio diagram configuration, the resulting diagram will have the axis labels scaled, but the information systems are still placed exactly as before at the border of the diagram."
