Attribute value ranges not checked for plausibility	It is possible to save (and thus import as well) a number attribute with lower bound 2, upper bound 10 and ranges "<= 1", "1 - 11", "=> 11". There should be a plausibility check whether the defined value ranges are consistent with the specified upper/lower bounds.
