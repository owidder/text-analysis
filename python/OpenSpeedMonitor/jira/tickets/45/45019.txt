User not always showing in the "show subscribers" list of an element, after subscribing to that element	"If a user subscribes to a building block, the ""show subscribers""-list correctly updates and shows said user, as well as the option to unsubscribe.
However if you switch to another page within iteraplan and return to the newly subscribed-to building block afterwards, the list doesn't show the user anymore, and instead of ""unsubscribe"" you're offered to subscribe. The same happens when you hit the browser's page refresh button.

The ""show subscribers""-list only shows the correct state again after either closing and reopening the building block's flow, or after click of ""refresh""."
