Enum attributes not assigned to a BBT are not exported in Excel template	Enum attributes that are not assigned to at least one building block type/relation are currently not exported in the Excel template.		Bug	iteraplan PO	08/May/12 4:21 PM	10/May/12 3:10 PM					attribute	enum	excel	export						08/May/12 9:55 PM;tse;If it is not in the Excel, then it is not in the meta model. Therefore, this sounds like there could be an issue in the model loader.	10/May/12 12:01 PM;lci;The enums are collected in MetamodelExport$ExportRun#createPropertiesForAttributeTypes() by itereting over all building block types. Of course, if none are set for the EnumAT, the attribute isn't shown.	10/May/12 3:10 PM;lci;Unassigned enums aren't intended.	10/May/12 3:13 PM;tse;ok - because attribute types (like enums) should be used somewhere if they are defined.	12/May/12 12:27 PM;vsh;Maybe we should refuse to save attributes that are not assigned to at least one BBT?
