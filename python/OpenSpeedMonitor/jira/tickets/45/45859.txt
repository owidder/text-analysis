XMI import requires specific ZIP-contents and fails with an exception otherwise	"The XMI import requires the ZIP-file to directly contain the files ""iteraplan.xmi"" and ""iteraplan.ecore"". As it is depending on the way one creates a ZIP-archive, whether the files are direct contents of the ZIP-archive or are contained in a directory in the ZIP-archive, it would be more useable if the importer would search for these files not only in the direct contents, but also in possible directories contained in the archive. In Mac OS X (and Windows, I guess) one can e.g. place these two files in a folder and right-click the folder to create a ZIP-file of it. In this case, the XMI and ECore-files would be in a folder inside the ZIP-file, and the importer would fail (with a TechnicalException if I remember correctly) without displaying any hints or even a proper error message.
Furthermore, it would make the importer more useable if the files could have any name, as long as the filename-extension indicates its contents.
As a last point, I would suggest to not require the ECore file to be present in the archive, but instead use the current metamodel of the data as a fallback.

A good entry point for a possible implementation seems to be the following class:
