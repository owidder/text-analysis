Create a DateInterval Hibernate entity	"Create a {{DateInterval}} entity class with corresponding mapping etc. It should have following properties:
* Name
* Default colour (like {{EnumAV}} objects have them)
* Start date - reference to a {{DateAT}} attribute type
* End date - reference to a {{DateAT}} attribute type

When one of the referenced {{DateAT}} objects is deleted, this should cascade to the DateInterval as well.

Then, create a corresponding DAO and Service implementation that allow retrieving all available DateInterval objects.

----

The idea is to have several of such DateIntervals defined and use them in masterplan diagram configuration later on.
In a first step, we only need these DateIntervals as read-only objects, i.e. we provide the customer some SQL to prepare the desired DateIntervals and that's it - no UI for creating and changing those objects.

There is one side-effect, though, reported in ITERAPLAN-1497. Please have a look at it soon."
