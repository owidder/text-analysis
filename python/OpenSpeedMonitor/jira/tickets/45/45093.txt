See old ticket #2341 for more details"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	22/Aug/11 11:01 AM	20/Oct/11 2:35 PM														23/Sep/11 2:33 PM;sfe;Documentation updated, as well.	27/Sep/11 11:02 AM;sfe;the macros to copy an information flow diagram's layout should be included into the EE-distribution template as well.	28/Sep/11 3:46 PM;sfe;Including of above mentioned macros into the EE-distribution template doesn't seem to work, so the layout-copy macros will be provided separately.	"12/Oct/11 7:10 PM;sry;There is one feature missing in the EE Visio template: interface arcs do not have the ""iteraplan Link"" entry in their context menus. In the CE template, that entry exists. 
To be fair, that was probably my fault when I built that template earlier this year..."
