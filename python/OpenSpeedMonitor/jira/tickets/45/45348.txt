Circular paths between elements in a VBB based visualization should not be selectable	"Example: In a Nesting Cluster Diagram, if you select InformationSystemReleases as outer elements and TechnicalComponentReleases as inner elements, you get the option to choose the path ""technicalComponentReleases.infrastructureElementAssociation.technicalComponentReleases"". Since each of the association building blocks between technical component releases and infrastructure elements can only hold one technical component release, this path just leads back to the original technical component releases.
Such cases shouldn't be offered for selection to reduce cluttering and confusion over the available choices."

I will adjust the title and other metadata accordingly."	08/May/13 11:30 AM;sbu;Not longer relevant as VBB code is removed or reworked.
