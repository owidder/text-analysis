Error with Pie-Charts when all selected building blocks have the same value in the selected attribute	"The pie diagram has problems displaying a ""all values are the same"" state, for example if create a new enum attribute for information systems and you assign to all 52 information systems of the bank data the same value for this attribute type, then create a pie chart for this attribute type.

Reported errors are a full circle displayed right above the circle outline of the pie chart or just a thin line instead of a full circle (see attached file)."

As I just changed some more code, please retest by someone else.	19/Jan/12 11:48 AM;lci;When generating the pie chart for a large(r) number of elements (e.g. in the bank data all 52 IS), the error persists. The empty circle (the circumference) is drawn, and the color is put above the empty circle.	19/Jan/12 5:41 PM;lci;Ok.
