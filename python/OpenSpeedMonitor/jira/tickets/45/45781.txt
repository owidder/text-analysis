Mass Data.Export/Import: Time Series GUI Part Is Inconsistent with the Rest	The GUI components for the export of time series attributes does not match the layout of the rest. There is no row description like *Metamodel* and *Model* and the options to export to Excel 2003 and Excel 2007 are in a different order. It would be more intuitive to have it look the same for both parts.
