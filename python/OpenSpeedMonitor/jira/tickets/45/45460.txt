Elastic Model loader does not take alternate datasources into consideration	"The elastic Model & meta model loader is currently hard-wired to use the master data source. As it runs in a separate thread, it is uninfluenced by the current datasource setting in the thread-bound UserContext. Effectively, queries against that (meta) model will always reflect the data in the master data source, but never the data in other data source.

It would be more consistent if separate models & meta-models are kept for each active data source. As the RoutingDataSource has a limit on the number of concurrently active data sources, resource consumption for the models would still remain limited."
