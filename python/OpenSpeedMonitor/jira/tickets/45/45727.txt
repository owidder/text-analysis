Null entries in ID_PARENT column of hierarchical elements	"In some customer's data there were infrastructure elements found with null values in their ID_PARENT and also POS columns.
This obviously shouldn't happen, as each building block of a type with a virtual root element should have a parent id set (except the virtual root element).

Please investigate how such a state could occur (primary suspect here is the Excel Importer, especially IteraplanModelDiffWriter) and fix the issue."
