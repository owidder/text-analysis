Excel Export: Introduce ordering to the Excel Export	"The Excel Export is unordered.
Only the sequence of the sheets some universal type expressions is fixed by an exlicit ordering (UniversalTypeExpressionOrderFix).

In order to be able to
 - work with a stable document between exports
 - compare two exports efficently automatically
it would be good to:

1. Fix the order of all generated sheets (UTE, RE, Enums)
2. Fix the ordering of the columns in every sheet
3. Fix the ordering of the rows (by name or id, as appropriate)"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	25/Jul/13 9:25 AM	30/Dec/15 2:53 PM					excel	export	usability							"25/Jul/13 9:28 AM;jme@iteratec.de;UTE:

if there are two relationships between types, such as predecessor/successor and parent/base, it is not yet reproducable, which one is on the first sheet (e.g. IS-IS) and which os on the second page (IS-IS-002).

Fixed. Deterministic with the ordering of the relationship-sheets."	"25/Jul/13 10:29 AM;jme@iteratec.de;Performance of the export:

(?) Ordering of the relationship sheets
(?) Position of the attributed relationships
(?) sorting of the content of the STE and RTE (if any)
(?) order of the columns of the STE and RTE"	"08/Aug/13 5:17 PM;jme@iteratec.de;*Attention*
The current implementation of the ordering of the additional attributes of the SubstantialTypes is solely based on the position of the attribute group and the attribute.

In iteraplan one or more attribute groups can be marked as ""show next to the core"". The attributes of these groups are then displayed on the first page of the SubstantialType, right after the built-in features.

So currently in the excel file these groups are *NOT* displayed directly after the built-in features."	"24/Oct/13 10:11 AM;aer;A consistent ordering throughout the Excel file would be great. If you happen to need to compare generated Excel files with exported ones it makes your work much easier.

The SubstantialTypes should be ordered by their name, relational types by a defined ordering, i.e., one of its associated building blocks.

It would also be very nice to have the sheets ordered lexicographically to easier find esp. relations and enumeration attributes."
