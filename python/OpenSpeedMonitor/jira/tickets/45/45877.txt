ConsistencyCheck - wrong results, wrong links	"The Consistency Checks - General Landscape - Nr4: shows all the InformationSystems without the releases, Links are not working, since they are the BaseInformationSystem type and not the release type.
Also the BusinessMappings and the Relationships make no sense either."		Bug	iteraplan PO	12/Jul/13 6:29 AM	15/Jul/13 6:26 PM
