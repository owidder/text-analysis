Check for BBT assignement before saving an attribute	The validation logic for attributes can be enhanced by checking whether a BBT has been assigned to the attribute before it is saved. Then there will be no problems with the Excel export of attributes (ITERAPLAN-709).		Improvement	iteraplan PO	14/May/12 10:09 AM	30/Dec/15 2:32 PM					attribute	validation								16/May/12 10:19 AM;csh;After the migration of the meta-model to elasticEAM, this issue will partially be not longer existent. In an elasticEAM meta-model, the user cannot create properties that are not assigned to a type. Nevertheless, it may be possible to create enumerations that are not used by any property. For the latter case, a meta-model check for unused enumerations may be helpful.	31/Jul/12 1:28 PM;kvo;in Elastic no issue
