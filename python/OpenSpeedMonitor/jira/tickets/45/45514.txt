Cycle consistency checks don't work in all cases when introducing cyclic relations upon creating a building block	"Example:

EA Data > Information Systems > Create new...

1)	Choose a name and release name
2)	Predecessor: an arbitrary system
3)	Successor: the same system
4)	save

The system can be saved, although that should be prevented and a cycle should be detected and reported as error message."

Just a minor remark: Rather use {{Integer.valueOf()}} instead of {{new Integer()}}; that might avoid object instantiation.	03/May/12 11:21 AM;lci;Works fine.
