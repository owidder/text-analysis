Spreadsheet Reports - Excel 2007: Fill sheets that exist in the template with data, whenever possible	"As an iteraplan user I want to create templates with sheets that are filled with data by the report.
I expect sheets to be filled, when they have exact the same name as sheets that are generated by the report.

This gives me the opportunity to predefine evaluations in the template, that make use of these sheets.

Note:
All data existing in a sheet, that is filled by the report can be erased beforehand."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	13/Aug/13 10:17 AM	27/Mar/17 1:25 PM					excel	reports								"13/Aug/13 11:14 AM;jme@iteratec.de;There is a bug in the current implementation.

Create and upload a template with 3 predefined sheets. E.g. ""ExcelTemplateSheet"", ""first_custom"", ""second_custom"", ""third_custom""
Use the template with a report (e.g. Information Systems)

Result: The position of the ""ExcelTemplateSheet"" is NOT at the end of all sheets BUT at the position last but three.
So you have ""first_custom"", ""second_custom"", ""third_custom"", ... generated sheets ..., *""ExcelTemplateSheet""*, ""Technical Components"", ""Infrastructure Elements"", ""Projects""

The ""ExcelTemplateSheet"" should always be the last sheet."	13/Aug/13 11:40 AM;jme@iteratec.de;Fixed the bug.	"13/Aug/13 11:42 AM;jme@iteratec.de;Open issue:
make sure, that the focus is set to the first cell of filled sheets.

To archive this, you have to use a combination of
sheet.showInPane((short)0, (short)0); (that moves the view to the beginning of the page)
and
sheet.getRow(0).getCell(0).setAsActiveCell(); (that sets the focus)

Unfortunately there are bugs in the POI so that
XLS: doesn't set the focus correct
XLSX: doesn't shift the view to the beginning of the page.

Solution:
remove any sheet, that is to be filled and create a new one.
It doesn't make any differences in regard to the formulars on other pages."	"13/Aug/13 3:27 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Open issue:
The formulas in the workbook have to be recalculated or else the cached values will be displayed.

Problem with that: if there is an error in a formular in the template, the report will not be created.

Better solution: the user has to force the recalculation of the formulars in the workbook by pressing Ctrl-Alt-F9 after opening the workbook in Excel."	"13/Aug/13 3:29 PM;jme@iteratec.de;In the code there is an attempt, to set the first visible tab to the first sheet in the workbook.

However, this isn't done in the right way. ""setSelectedTab"" is used. But this merrely selects the tab. A different tab is displayed, when the workbook is opened.

This bug should be fixed.

Fixed by using ""setFirstVisibleTab(0)""."	"14/Aug/13 10:09 AM;jme@iteratec.de;Regardless how the sheet is filled (either by using the existing sheet and removing the content or by removing and recreating the sheet), in Excel 2003 the formulas are broken.

Even when the sheet is preserved, the content is not deleted and existing cells are reused.

I will create a follow-up ticket to investigate the circumstances further.

Follow-up ticket: ITERAPLAN-1865"	"26/Aug/13 5:31 PM;sfe;When doing an Excel report with custom template, already existing sheets named like those created by the excel report are disregarded and replaced by the ones created by the report.
It does not matter what columns in which order are present in the template, the resulting sheet is always the same as the standard sheet created by the reports. As such it is not possible to configure the report output with the current solution."	"30/Aug/13 2:15 PM;sry;Suggestion: Roll back these changes for 3.2 and postpone the issue.

My strong impression is that this has been though through carefully enough. Looking at Stephan's test result, a lot of work is probably left to be done."	27/Mar/17 1:25 PM;fka;No longer relevenat
