Excel Import: the import fails trying to import two new Building Blocks with the same name	"How to reproduce:

1. Download Excel-Template from Administration->Excel Import page
2. In the template put two Business Domains with the same name. No other information is required.
3. Import the template

The same applies for Business Process and Business Functions. Other building blocks have the problem, I guess."		Bug	iteraplan PO	27/Jan/12 3:45 PM	04/Apr/12 7:04 PM					excel	import
