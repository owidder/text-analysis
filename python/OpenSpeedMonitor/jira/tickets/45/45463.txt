Button Delete should not delete data physical in DB	"today often data is deleted through our subunits in iteraplan caused by misunderstanding it.

In this case i get notification by mail but cannot ""repair"" data easily ... I have to add a new information-system with all interfaces and references to other elements in iteraplan to ""rollback"" the deletion (very error-prone, information often is hard to find after this). 

Please provide new function/method so that  button ""delete"" only ""virtual delete"" this systems (set flag ""deleted"" after that only specific user are able to see them - they should habe permissions to recover our physical delete these systems).
