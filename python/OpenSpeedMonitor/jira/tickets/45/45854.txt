Click ""Download template"" in the ""Excel Import of Landscape Data""-block.
Save the template and import it. Look at the textlog if everything imported successfully.


Importer asks for functional permission Menu 'Business Mapping', but should ask for create and update 'Business Mapping' permissions. Create/update/delete permissions were set for this user/role.

Please note: this permission issue may also apply for all other building blocks besides Business Mapping!"
