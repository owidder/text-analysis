Exception handling for functions with MVC-based UI	"Currently a separate exception handler for IteraplanExceptions is registred only in Webflow. If a MVC-based site throws an exception it is catched by Tomcat and the request ends in the general error page. 

The following is desired:
* a separate exception handler for our exception hierarchie which writes in our usual log file.
* this handler must be active for all controllers.
* the handler deletes the header _Content-disposition_ from the response. Otherwise browsers won't display the error page if 500 error code comes back while the download header is still set. The _Content-Type_ is reset by Tomcat during rendering of the JSP, therefore no ""manual"" reset of this header is necessary.
