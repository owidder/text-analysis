Audit logfile download page is not accessible via menu	"If the property ""audit.logging.enabled"" in ""iteraplan.properties"" is set to true, and the functional permission ""Download audit logfile"" is assigned, then the menu entry for the download page is still not displayed (?).

The page (/jsp/Miscellaneous/*) can be accessed manually:
[host]:[port]/iteraplan/miscellaneous/init.do

Or the direct link:
[host]:[port]/iteraplan/miscellaneous/requestAuditLogFile.do

Maybe the page needs a little styling."

bq.{{log4j.logger.de.iteratec.iteraplan.businesslogic.common.AuditLogger=INFO, auditlogfile}}

Maybe this additional configuration effort could be avoided, or at least should be documented."
