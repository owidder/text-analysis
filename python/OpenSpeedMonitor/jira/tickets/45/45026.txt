Fix for the bug described in this ticket. The bug was caused in the context of a match between the selected line dimension attribute and the existing attributes during the saving of a query. The actual cause was that the matching was made against the attributes available for Information Systems and not against the attributes available for Interfaces, the result being that no line dimension attribute is saved, if it is not also available for Information Systems. Furthermore, the following changes were made:

 * The property whether base Technical Components should be displayed (Information Flow Diagram) is now also being saved in the corresponding query.
 * Since the matching between selected and existing attributes is actually not necessary during the saving of a query, the corresponding logic was removed from all diagrams, with the exception of the Landscape Diagram. Thus, the provided solution affects all diagrams except the Landscape Diagram. "
