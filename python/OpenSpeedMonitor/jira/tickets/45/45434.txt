Remove Dojo with JQuery where easily possible	"With the change to the new Bootstrap based UI (ITERAPLAN-511) we made the shift to JQuery as a major JavaScript library.
Please change all Dojo-Calls with JQuery ones where easily possible to clarify that JQuery is the standard and Dojo the exception in using JavaScript."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	15/Mar/12 2:34 PM	30/Mar/12 8:11 PM														30/Mar/12 12:42 PM;sry;Are there plans to re-implement the currently disabled validations? (search all JSP files for "Spring." to find the few remaining)	"30/Mar/12 12:56 PM;sry;It would be great if JAWR could be reconfigured sp that Dojo is no longer part of the iteraplan.js bundle, i.e. is not loaded with each and every page any more. Dashboard should be the only page where Dojo is still included. --> Update: *I'm working on that*

If Spring JS stuff could be removed completely, I'd be very happy to see the spring-js dependency removed. It comes with a bundled Dojo+Dijit distribution and would be great to have that removed."	"30/Mar/12 8:11 PM;sry;I tried to remove the spring-js-resources.jar with the complete (old) Dojo distribution, and it looked fine, until I realized that the chart segment mouse-over label aren't displayed any more. So I had to revert most of my changes and created a patch file that removes that JAR. Maybe we can use it in the future, after the tooltip issue could be fixed.

re Testing: Everything else looks fine, provided that Michael is going to commit validation on the few remaining text boxes soon. Use of Dojo/Dijit is now really strictly localized on the Dashboard page, everthying else is jQuery :-)"	30/Mar/12 8:13 PM;sry;My almost succesful attempt at removing Spring's embedded Dojo, to replace it with a smaller custom-built version
