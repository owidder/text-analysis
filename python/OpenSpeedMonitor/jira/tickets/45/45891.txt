iteraplan shows a warning message "cannot delete item" anytime a new information system is created or modified.	"System works correctly (information systems can be created and modified but not deleted), only problem is the error message always appearing.

Expectation: After dismissing the warning once, it should not appear again the next time."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	15/Jul/13 10:31 AM	11/Sep/14 10:27 AM					permissions									13/Aug/14 11:25 PM;fka;Is this still applicable?	14/Aug/14 2:40 PM;cort.comish@berlin-airport.de;yes, the issue is still applicable. Our expectation is that the warning message should not appear at all, since it is unnecessary and disruptive. It is sufficient that the delete command is disabled in the menu.	28/Aug/14 12:08 PM;iteraplan;Talk to WFR or FKA before starting with this ticket	04/Sep/14 7:05 PM;fka;As before: Please remove the edit / delete / create  buttons / menu entries from the GUI if the user does not have sufficient rights to execute the action.
