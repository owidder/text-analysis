Subscription Emails still sent for users without role or without permission to view the changed building block type	"If a user subscribes to a building block, and then the user's roles are deleted or the permission to view the according building block type is removed, said user still gets the notification emails for changes to the subscribed building block. In case the roles were deleted, this only happens for changes which don't affect an attribute type group needing explicit read permission.

Notification emails shouldn't be sent to users without the permission to view the according building blocks."
