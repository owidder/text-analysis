Create a shortcut to assign a attribute to all building block types	"When creating a new attribute in iteraplan which should be available to all elements, right now one has to manually select each single Building Block Type, click on the +-sign next to the dropdown list and choose the next one. This results in at least 16*2=32 clicks per attribute one wants to create.

It would be good to have a button that creates all these associations at once, e.g. ""add all""."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	09/Jul/13 5:28 PM	30/Dec/15 2:53 PM					AttributeType	usability								10/Jul/13 1:01 PM;sry;Nice idea, thanks!
