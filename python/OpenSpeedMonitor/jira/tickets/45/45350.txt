Bar and Pie charts don't work with large data sets	"* When the result set is too large, and the button ""Send query & use results"" is clicked, then a java.lang.StackOverflowError appears. This was tested with multiple memory settings.
* The error same occurs, if a large saved query is loaded by clicking on its name.
