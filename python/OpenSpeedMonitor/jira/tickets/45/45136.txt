Text of name legend in the visualisation tab of building blocks too long	"Example: When visualizing some information systems, in particular those with long names containing many uppercase or otherwise ""wide"" letters (like 'W' and 'M'), in an information flow diagram via the visualisation tab, the entry in the names legend can overflow (see screenshot).
Visualizing the same element in an information flow diagram using the graphical reports page seems to work properly though."
