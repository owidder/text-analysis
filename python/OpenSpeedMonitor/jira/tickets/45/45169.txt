Show edit link for attribute groups only if permissions to edit attributes exists	Show edit link for attribute groups only if permissions to edit attributes exists		Improvement	iteraplan PO	01/Oct/11 9:35 AM	11/Oct/11 11:38 AM														06/Oct/11 10:40 AM;bsi;If the user has functional permissions for ATGs and no explicit permissions for ATGs the link is not available. But the user still can edit an ATG as he has functional permissions. Maybe would be better if the link is available if the user has functional permissions for ATGs.	"06/Oct/11 11:19 AM;vsh;This is a bug in the Attribute Type Groups page. If a user doesn't have functional permission for the ATG page, the link should be shown (this is the case now). If a user has fuctional permission for the ATG menu but only read permission for the ATG, the link shouldn't be shown (which also corresponds to the current state). The link must only be shown if the user has functional permission to view the ATG page and write permission for the ATG (this is how it is impelemneted now).

At the moment, read permission restrictions are ignored when editting an ATG in the ATG page (see ITERAPLAN-290)."	06/Oct/11 11:26 AM;bsi;OK	10/Oct/11 3:11 PM;vsh;Users can edit attribute type groups if only if they hace func permissions for menu "Attributy Type Group". Write permission for the particular attribute type group is not necessary (according to Steffen).
