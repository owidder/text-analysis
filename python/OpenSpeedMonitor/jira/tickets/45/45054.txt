Users without permission for Information Systems cannot generate some diagrams	"As a consequence of changes made in ITERAPLAN-11, a user without functional permission cannot generate Cluster diagrams, masterplan diagram, portfolio diagrams. For landscape diagrams it works, and for information diagram it's sensible to disallow access.

It should still be possible to use these diagrams for all the other building block types."		Bug	iteraplan PO	20/Jul/11 7:21 PM	06/Sep/11 3:56 PM														20/Jul/11 7:28 PM;sry;Same problem with bulk updates, is only accessible if IS permission is assigned.	02/Sep/11 12:26 PM;sfe;Bug exists, like described, in version 2.8.1. In 2.9.M2 and trunk it seems to work fine though, possibly fixed by other changes in the meantime.	06/Sep/11 3:56 PM;rbe;it works (cluster, masterplan, protofolio). The problem that occured by bulk updates was corrected in corresponding ticket (#218) which might have also corrected this one.
