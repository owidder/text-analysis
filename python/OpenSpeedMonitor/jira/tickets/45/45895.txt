Build iteraplan 3.1.RC2	"Prepare the release of iteraplan 3.1.RC2:
* Update *all* customization sets so that they reflect all changes that were made between 3.0 and 3.1
* Review and update documentation, and build a fresh User Guide PDF.
* Have localization files updated, where possible.
* Update release notes
* One-time task: For the installer, change the process to create a file {{README.txt}} instead of only {{README}}. (This makes it easier for Windows users.)
* Create a stable release version of Spring Security Extensions (/)
* Extract incremental migration scripts from the one-big-step scripts.
* Create a new pair of history initialization scripts for iteraplan 3.1
* Update the iTURM distribution, if necessary


Finally, build all release artefacts, according to the release process description."		Task	iteraplan PO	16/Jul/13 7:46 PM	07/Aug/13 2:07 PM					release									"19/Jul/13 2:03 PM;svo;The following customizations need to be reviewed by someone who knows more about them, since some of the customized files have experienced major change in the trunk:
*fbb, isv, uniqa, servlet-container-auth, wacker*.
Most of the time the {{Navigation.jsp}} or {{applicationContext-spring-security.xml}} are affected.
The *zeiss* customization uses a very old version of {{Combobox.jsp}}.

Apart from that, all customizations are at least as new as the trunk files or have been updated accordingly."	24/Jul/13 1:05 PM;isc;The customizations must still be checked again! Changes to the JSP were not implemented in the customizations.
