Order in which attributes of an attributegroup are presented in detail pages changes between view and edit mode	"to reproduce:
# ensure a bunch of attributes are assigned to an attribute group and a bbt
# navigate to a bb of the bbt
# open attributes tab and expand the attribute group
# change to edit mode
=> order of attributes within the attributegroup changed
# switch back to view mode
=> order of attributes within the attributegroup changed again, it seems to be neither the one in edit mode nor the one in former view mode."
