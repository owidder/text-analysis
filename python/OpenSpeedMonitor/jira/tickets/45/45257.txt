Documentation for filtering with seal is missing	In addition to the documentation of the usage/editing of the seal itself the documentation for filtering options with seal (http://www.iteraplan.de/wiki/display/iteraplan/Formulating+queries) should be updated as well. In particular it is interesting to know how iteraplan behaves if none of the given boxes is checked.
