Imports must not allow forbidden characters in BB names	"The Excel import seems to allow importing information systems (and probably other types as well) with colons in their name, even though ':' is a forbidden character and cannot be saved via UI.

The Excel import should apply the same validation rules, i.e. reject ':' and '#'."		Bug	iteraplan PO	15/Mar/13 10:36 AM	22/May/13 5:21 PM					validation									"30/Apr/13 10:54 AM;lba;One ""Bug"" that appeared while testing the behaviour of the ModelValidator was, that not all the errors that exist in the excel import, are shown in the error message. It appears as if somewhere in the validation process, the validator stops and returns only a partial error message.

SRY: Could you fix that bug? Are validation error messages now always complete?"	"22/May/13 5:21 PM;bra;(/) looks good
(/) does not allow ':'
(/) does allow one '#' as separator between IS-Name and IS-ReleaseNumber (analogous for TCs)
(/) allows any number of '#' in names of buildingblocks of other types"	"22/May/13 8:25 PM;sry;The main aspect is fine. Pls open a separate issue if the problem with partial error messages persists.

Thx!"
