Adding BusinessMappings as a BuildingBlock to the UI	The BusinessMapping and their functionality are to be added as a sepparet BuildingBlock to the UI. It should be possible to visualisa, create, edit and delete BusinessMappings.		New Feature	iteraplan PO	22/Jul/11 11:29 AM	20/Oct/11 4:43 PM														"05/Oct/11 1:36 PM;sip;Functions for showing and editing business mapping are implemented.

Now i will work on these improvements:
* permissions should be noted
* filter for rows and columns, because the number of cells can become huge
* row and column updates: filling one row or one column with business mappings"	"14/Oct/11 12:51 PM;bsi;Iteraplan Technical Exception occurs when the 'All' option in the drop-down list is selected and then the request is executed.

If the 'All' option has no function, it'd be good to show the 'send request' button only if an product element has been selected (e.g '-')."	14/Oct/11 1:18 PM;bsi;Also the formatting in IE, Firefox and Chrome is different and there is also a line in the middle of the table (part of the page frame) (see screenshots)	"19/Oct/11 3:34 PM;sfe;Works as far as I could see. There are two points where improvements are necessary though, in my opinion:

 1. Please sort the entries in the dropdown lists. If you have a lot of elements to select from, it is very hard to find them when the list is unsorted.
 2. The buttons to navigate through the table (table-page left/right and up/down) allow you to navigate outside the boundaries of the table. You can keep going right, for example, long after there aren't any additional columns to show to the right anymore."	20/Oct/11 4:43 PM;sfe;seems fine
