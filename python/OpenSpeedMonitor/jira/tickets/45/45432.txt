Change iteraQL/QueryConsole to be based on new elasticEAM	Change iteraQL/QueryConsole to be based on new elasticEAM		New Feature	iteraplan PO	16/Mar/12 12:16 PM	16/Apr/12 3:23 PM														"23/Mar/12 1:30 PM;kgo;Known issues so far:

 * Representation of synthetic (derived) types will, in many cases, not be possible in the query console and will cause an exception. This is because some of the synthetic types can not be casted to a TypeOfBuildingBlock, or because the corresponding TypeOfBuildingBlock can not be derived from their name. The convenient solution for this issue would be to use a different presentation instead of the common iteraplan query result table.
 * Querying of RuntimePeriod is currently not possible. Since the RuntimePeriod is a BuiltinPrimitiveType it will probably be necessary to define extra filter predicates for this type.
 * When defining a date filter (in US English), the date value must be given in quotes (e.g. ""01/01/2012"" or '01/01/2012' instead of 01/01/2012). Otherwise the parser consideres the first slash to be a relationship end control character and fails to parse correctly, if at all."	27/Mar/12 3:57 PM;kgo;The handling of runtime period predicates will be covered in ITERAPLAN-601.	"28/Mar/12 12:31 PM;kgo;Some improvements of the backend and interfaces requested:
 * Offer an IteraQl2Compiler class, which manages the compilation of queries against an arbitrary metamodel.
 * Reconsider the interfaces ElasticeamManager and ElasticeamService."	04/Apr/12 4:17 PM;kgo;Documentation is still to be adjusted.	11/Apr/12 11:02 AM;kgo;Documentation now covers the new query language.
