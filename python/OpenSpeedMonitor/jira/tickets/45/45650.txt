Information Flow Diagram: Diagram title and content sometimes overlap in Visio-Export	This happens because our layouting doesn't factor in the space needed for the diagram title. Usually this isn't a problem, because the "cloud"-like layout often doesn't occupy the top-left corner. But especially with only few IS to display, overlapping with the title can happen.
