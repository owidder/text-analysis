Fix incorrect compareTo() implementations, make them align with equals()	"The reason for incorrect sort results when running iteraplan on Java 7 is that some of our {{compareTo()}} implementations violate that method's contract, most notably all (hierarchical?) building blocks.

The contract in {{Comparable}} dictates that {quote}The implementor must ensure sgn(x.compareTo( y )) == -sgn(y.compareTo( x )) for all x and y. (This implies that x.compareTo( y ) must throw an exception iff y.compareTo( x ) throws an exception.) {quote}
Most probably this correlates with [this findbugs warning|http://findbugs.sourceforge.net/bugDescriptions.html#EQ_COMPARETO_USE_OBJECT_EQUALS] which is simply suppressed.

Our implementation of compareTo() should be fixed so that it is consistent with equals()/hashCode() and adheres to the Comparable contract.

For reproduction, make sure to
