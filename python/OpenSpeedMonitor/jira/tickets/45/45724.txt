Partial Error Messages in Excel Import	"To reproduce:
1. export the excel data
2. create several errors(that our validator should detect) on different pages in the excel file
3. try to import it
 ==> import fails due to the erros in the excel file, but the error message doesn't contain every error that exist in the excel file.
Expected behaviour is, that every single error in the excel file is listed in the error message."

Example:
A date contains a String -> error in excel import.
A forbidden character in a InformationSystem -> error in Validator."	"24/Jul/13 3:15 PM;lba;If someone has concerns about the solution (always run validator even if excelimport fails), feel free to bring them up.
My biggest concern is: could errors which occur in the excel import, provoke errors in the validator? I talked with 
Stephan about it, he came to the conclusion that errors in the excel import will usually not cause errors in the validator.
