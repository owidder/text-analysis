Custom Dashboards not possible in Community Edition	"Since templates management page of iteraplan is not available in the community edition, but custom dashboard templates are defined using that page, custom dashboards cannot be used in the community edition.
This should be fixed either by introducing a separate page for custom dashboard templates, or by allowing the custom dashboard part of the templates management page to be displayed for the community user, too."
