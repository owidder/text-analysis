Timeseries: Decimal numbers can not be created.	"The customer U-100 has reported the following problem.
He has tested the timeseries and has created an number attribute as timeseries. After this he has try to add the value 50,9 to this attribute and got an error message. Please see the attachment (Zeitreihe.png) for the error message.
When I try to change the value again, I get the situation from the picture ""Fehlermeldung.png"".

Concerns the German language setting. In the English version it works.
