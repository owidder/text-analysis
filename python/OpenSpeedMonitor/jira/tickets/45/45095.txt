Excel Import removes child relation during an update-import	"Suppose you have a hierarchy over three levels (e.g. functions or processes). You want to update the description of an element on level 2 (let's call it ""A : B"").
If you import an excel file with just that row, the element ""A : B : C"" will have lost its parent afterwards, i.e. ""A : B"" does not keep its children during import."
