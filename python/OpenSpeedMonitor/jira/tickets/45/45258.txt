Nesting Cluster Diagram and Permissions	"So far the Nesting Cluster Diagram doesn't respect the functional permissions for editing and/or saving graphical reports properly, meaning you can edit and save reports even without the permissions.

Another problem are Error-Popups when loading the Nesting Cluster configuration page, caused by IteraplanBusinessExeptions thrown when necessary permissions aren't granted during the dwr AJAX call of the 'recommend' method of VbbConfigurationService."		Bug	iteraplan PO	15/Nov/11 9:38 AM	25/Nov/11 4:22 PM					ajax	permissions								21/Nov/11 1:53 PM;vsh;There still seem to be issues with the permission check: save a query for a Nesting Cluster Diagram containing relationships between Business Domain and Business Object (the user has read permissions for both BB types). Revoke then the permission for Business Domain and try to execute the query. An IndexOutOfBoundsException occurs.	"23/Nov/11 9:44 AM;vsh;Unfortunately, changes in the attribute group permissions are not accounted for when loading a saved Nesting Cluster query. Consider the following test case:

1) Assign an attribute group to a role that has permission to create new saved queries for diagram reports
2) Save a Nesting Cluster query referencing an attribute from that attribute group.
3) Assign the attribute group to a different role
4) Try to load or run the saved query: loading the query leaves the tag referencing the now invisible attribute blank and running the query returns an empty diagram.

Expected: a warning message that the user doesn't have the permission to load or run the query."	25/Nov/11 4:22 PM;vsh;Seems Ok to me now.
