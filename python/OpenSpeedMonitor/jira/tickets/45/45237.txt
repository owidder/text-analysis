Clear error messages in Excel Import page on new load	After chosing an ill formatted Excel file for the Excel import of landscape, an error message "Please select the Excel file with landscape data to import." is shown as expected. However, the message doesn't disappear after reloading the page via the menu on the left or after a successful import of attribute definitions. The error stack should be cleared when reloading a page (this may apply to other pages as well, please test).
