Line Chart: Saved query with date from/to set does not work with different languages 	"Experienced behaviour: I did some testing with the dashboard and had two line chart diagrams (two times the same saved query) included in my dashboard template. Worked fine for a long time and I didn't change this configuration during testing. Suddenly I get an error messages for the line chart (cf. Screenshot). Same error when executing the saved query for the line chart directly from visualization menu.
Expected behaviour: No problems ( :) ) as I didn't change the configuration at all. 

Now I got the problem: I did one change, I changed the language from german to english and the different date format (german ""xx.xx.xxxx"" to english xx/xx/xxxx) from the input fields somehow cause the problem... So, apparently saving a line chart definition in german and executing it in english does not work!

(x) There seems to be a problem with the date formats, when changing the language
To Reproduce:
1.) Select one diagram-type with a date selection
2.) Change the language
3.) Now update the date fields for the ""correct"" date format (click in them and select the same date again)
4.) Send Query ---> Error
The error messasge is the same as the one in the attached screenshot, the only difference is that you have entered the correct date format.
The error does not appear when you use the old date format e.g. you had german language selected and switched to english, it accepts the date format dd.mm.jjjj, but not the english one dd/mm/yyyy."	"18/Jul/13 11:09 AM;lba;See previous comment.
