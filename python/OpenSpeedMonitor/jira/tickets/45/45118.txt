Consistency Checks - Information System Landscape Nr. 11	"This check requests if there is there exits a ""point in time"" where both applications are not active at the same time. That would mean, that all applications (connected by interfaces) should have the exact same start and termination date. One should consider if this request makes sense.

Although if the request is senseful, it does not work properly. If one application has no start and no termination date (runs infinite) and the other application has for example a start date, this interface is not always displayed in the list, but should so. There are also several other examples, it is easy to reproduce. Just create two applications a corresponding interface and change the dates accordingly.

So on the one hand, the check in principle is not very senseful, and on the other hand not working properly, especially relating to infinite dates."
