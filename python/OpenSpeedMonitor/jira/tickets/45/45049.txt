Filter remove - Link	Link to remove a saved filter is not designed as a button		Improvement	iteraplan PO	19/Jul/11 2:01 PM	14/Oct/11 12:02 PM														19/Jul/11 2:38 PM;sry;Which /remove/ do you mean? Screenshot would be fine.	19/Jul/11 2:54 PM;cte;Screenshot	"28/Jul/11 6:44 PM;sry;There is a layout issue that could be addressed in this issue right away (though not part of the initial description).

After you have selected a custom filter, the filter paging/filtering line gets too cluttered, see screenshot. At least that's the case with a German UI where words are so long ;)

I'd suggest to move the part ""filtered by blabla"" and ""remove filter"" is permanently moved to new line below and displayed centred. Maybe we can even put some background colour behind it, to make it more obvious --> just introduce a CSS class for that."	03/Aug/11 12:07 PM;sry;Can you move the filter dropdown back to the upper line and adjust the lower line as centered? That would look more balanced, I guess.	"05/Aug/11 10:45 AM;rbe;  1. the filter dropdown has no effect on rendering of results when a filter is selected (eg i chosed 10 IS/page and showed them all)
  2. above comment of Steffen not considered before giving ticket ""to test"" status"	30/Sep/11 10:29 PM;kvo;Bitte schauen was hier nun der Stand ist.	"06/Oct/11 12:10 PM;bsi;The 'Results per page' dropdown list is not offered, therefore the user can't select the number of results per page. Appart from that everything else is fine.

I suggest to include the 'Results per page' dropdown list as otherwise it's unclear when there are too many results shown on the page."	13/Oct/11 12:13 PM;sry;I agree, the number of results per page should definitely be available. Same for the page flipping buttons, of course. And I don't really like how this status line looks when a filter is selected, because it's completely cluttered and too wide to display properly.	"13/Oct/11 1:28 PM;kvo;Please only do the Button-Part. This is - at least in  the nightly - not done/working!
For the pagination a new issue is valid, see ITERAPLAN-304"	14/Oct/11 12:02 PM;kgo;Button is fine.
