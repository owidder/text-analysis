iteraQL permission problem with association building blocks	"Example:
The query
{{TC/tc2tcrieassociation/tcrieassociation2ie;}}
when logged in with a not ""system"" user, leads to an error stating you don't have the permissions to execute this query.

Reason is that the permission for TcrIeAssociation is checked with a call of the {{userHasPermissionForModelEntity}} method of {{IteraplanPermissionsProvider}}, but no entry for these association building blocks exists in the permissions map of the class {{Permissions}}, which is used for the permissions check.

This also leads to problems with the nesting cluster graphic when trying to create a diagram involving a relationship-path including such an association building block."
