Provide possibility to clear the Hibernate second-level cache	"There should be a button in Admin area, where the user has the possibility to clear caches. For example after direct changes in DB.

Example implementation:
{code}
SessionFactoryImpl sessionFactoryImpl = (SessionFactoryImpl)session.getSessionFactory();
Map cacheRegionsMap = sessionFactoryImpl.getAllSecondLevelCacheRegions();
Collection<Cache> cacheRegions = cacheRegionsMap.values();
for (Cache cache : cacheRegions) {
    cache.clear();
}
{code}"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	03/Aug/11 9:41 AM	01/Sep/11 10:04 AM					cache	hibernate								01/Sep/11 10:04 AM;sfe;A screenshot on the documentation page showing the "Clear Cache" button would be nice, but should be clear enough like it is now, too.	01/Sep/11 10:57 AM;kvo;Reference to cache also included in installation manual, see http://www.iteraplan.de/wiki/display/iteraplan/Other+Configuration+Options+and+Notes
