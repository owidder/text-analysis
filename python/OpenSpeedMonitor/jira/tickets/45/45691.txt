Rename the labels for the various Excel exports to improve clarity for the user	Improving clarity for the average user: Please change the labels from "Excel" to "Excel 2003 (XLS)" and "Excel 2007" to "Excel (XLSX)". This affects at least the import/export page and the spreadsheet report output select box.

Reason:
In ticket ITERAPLAN-1482 is suggested, to rename the underlaying packages, such that the legacy excel export remains unchanged. 
This means, that in the code the package ""excel"" means excel 2003. In the UI Excel means Excel 2007.

This is not a big thing but considering the various existing excel export and imports (including timeline) the wrong naming leads to failure.

I suggest to use different names for the packages, than proposed in the ticket ITERAPLAN-1482."	"02/May/13 5:34 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Affected pages:

shall I change the order of appearance?

Currently: 
Excel 2003 (XLSX) 
Excel (XLSX)

Proposal:
Excel (XLSX)
Excel 2003 (XLS)

SRY: Sorry, saw it only now. Yes, please change the order as you suggested.
Please do also rename the labels on the Import/Export page."	"03/May/13 2:29 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Why isn't there a constant variable for graphicalExport.informationFlowDiagram?

SRY: Not sure what you mean with ""constant variable"" ;-) - but if a message key is missing, please add it."	22/May/13 4:47 PM;bra;(/) looks good
