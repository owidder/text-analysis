Deleting attributes does not delete them from selection lists of information flows	"How to reproduce:

Start information flow diagram until you reach second screen.
Delete an attribute valid for ""line type"" (and maybe colour).
Go back in information flow diagram (go to first screen) and then go to second screen.

while the attribute is removed from the selection list of colouring the building blocks, it is still available in the selection list of line types."
