Wrong coloring in pie charts	"If visualizing a 100%-proportion for enumeration attributes in pie charts the resulting diagram is white instead of being colored in the color choosen for this particular attribute value (see attachement).

The folowing steps were made to create the attached pie chart:
# select ""pie charts"" and ""information systems""
# check only the ""current""-box for information systems
# ""send query & use results""
# select ""attributes"" for coloring
# select ""Status"" as attribute to be used
# select ""Attribute Values"" to be analyzed
# check the ""show segment labels""-box in advanced settings
# generate diagram"		Bug	iteraplan PO	16/Nov/11 10:58 AM	09/Mar/12 1:31 PM					chart	color	pie							09/Mar/12 1:30 PM;kvo;Duplicate solved
