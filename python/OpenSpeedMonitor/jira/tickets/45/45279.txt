Report Memory Beans and related services improvements	"Currently the memory beans used for the various reports and the related services (especially frontend services) are quite confusing to understand and show signs of ""patchwork"" from having new functionality ""hacked in"", especially related to the Nesting Cluster Diagram.
The various parts of functionality these beans and services provide, and where they are necessary, should be analyzed and the whole structure refactored accordingly, to avoid errors from unused and overlooked functionality (see for example comment to changeset #14726 in ITERAPLAN-386)."
