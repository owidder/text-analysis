Subscription option for History Tab	An interesting feature for companies with big models may be the possibility to subscribe for the history tracking of certain building blocks or building block types in a way similar to the way notification emails work. Both may even share the same model and data structures. The difference will be that the history tab will present an overview of all changes and the emails will contain only the last change.
