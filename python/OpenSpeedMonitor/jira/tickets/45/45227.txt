Rename all DB tables to lowercase, eliminate native sequence	"From time to time we run into problems because iteraplan's tables MySQL are in different cases on Windows vs. Linux. This could be avoided if all of our tables (and probably columns as well) were consistently written in lowercase, because this will behave identically on Win and Linux. At the same time, the quote signs around AV_RANGE should be removed (which were only necessary with the previous name RANGE).

The second aspect is that we still have a native sequence generator configured for class DataSource. This implies that schemas for Oracle always have the additional sequence, even though it's no longer actually used (iteraplan doesn't write to that table). It should be changed to the same sequence generator that all others classes use."
