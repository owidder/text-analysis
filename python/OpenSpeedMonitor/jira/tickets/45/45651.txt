Rename the packages for the excel-export and -import	"Suggestion:

instead of excel and excel2 there should be 3 different packages:
 - elasticExcel (for the import/export into/from the elastic model aka excel2)
 - timeseriesExcel (for the import of the timeseries attributes; currently included in the excel-package)

 - excel (unchanged, for the ""old"" excel-stuff)

rename ""excel"" in ""legacyExcel"""	30/Apr/13 6:40 PM;lba;The test case testIsFileExistingAndDelete() in the test class  ExcelRoundtripTest depends on the test case testExcelExport() in the same class. Since junit doesn't execute tests in a fixed order, this can result in a test failure. (Also remember that test should be isolated and not depend on any other test cases.)	07/May/13 9:12 AM;jme@iteratec.de;I agree with that.
