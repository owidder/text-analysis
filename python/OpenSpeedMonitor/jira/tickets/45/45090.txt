Update JDBC drivers, make JDBC URL configurable per installer, correct installer wordings	"Responding to customer feedback, the following should be done:
* Update Oracle JDBC driver that we ship. Ours is more than 5 years old and out-of support. They recommended version 11.2.0.2.0, but check Oracle's compatibility matrix first. (/)
* In the installer, it should be made more clear that ""database name"" means SID if Oracle is used. (/)
* The installer should explicitly mention ""directory"" where directories are expected, not ""path"". The directory picker should be used where possible (inconsistent at the moment) (/)
* Make sure that the hibernate.cfg.xml is no longer packaged into the WAR by the installer. (/)

Out of scope (decision by fka):
* Change the installer so that the JDBC URL can be optionally specified explicitly. More and more customers want to use a JDBC URl with an Oracle service name instead of the ""classical"" form."
