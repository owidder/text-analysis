Loading of saved Pie and Bar charts doesn't properly check for attributes which might not exist anymore	"Reproducer:
 * Use bank data
 * create a pie chart displaying the costs of information systems (for example) and save the report
 * delete the attribute costs
 * load the saved report: there is no warning/notice displayed, only the attribute selection is empty.
 * directly execute report: executes without warning/error, shows empty diagram

There should be, like in other reports, a warning message when attribute types which don't exist anymore are referred to in a saved report, when trying to load or execute said report."
