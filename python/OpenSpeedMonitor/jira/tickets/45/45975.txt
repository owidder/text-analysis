Projects with colon in the name are rejected	"Projects exported from Iteraplan 3.0.4 (via Excel) and loaded into Iteraplan 3.1 are rejected if they have a colon in the name. For example, ""Project Revolution: Phase 1"".

Removing the colors from the Excel project tab names, and the proj-is tab names, which narrows down the issue. This problem will affect ongoing data feeds with an external system that allows colons in project names."

When you do that, you should version the file format and document all of the changes between the old and new formats.
