Undefined attribute values can be imported for Enumeration Attributes sepcified as time series using "Import timeseries data"	"According to the Specification one can use the ""import timeseries data"" function to import attribute values for time series. A user can enter attribute values in an excel table which are not predefined in the system for an enumeration attribute. This value can then be imported in the next step and is accepted an persisted by the system.

The import process should only accept pre-defined enum values in an excel file, and ignore other values (with an error message)"		Bug	iteraplan PO	03/Jul/13 6:18 PM	17/Jul/13 3:35 PM					timeseries									08/Jul/13 1:07 PM;sry;Pls make sure that the validation is performed in the lowest meaningful layer, not too close to the UI.	"17/Jul/13 9:08 AM;isc;In consultation with Stephan, that behavior is correct.
Enumeration attributes are not static attributes. It is possible to change the possible attribute values later. So it could be that enumeration attributes for time series contains values which are not predefined in the system for an enumeration attribute. Therefore it is also possible to import values which are not predefined. Only the last value (currently valid value) is checked.
