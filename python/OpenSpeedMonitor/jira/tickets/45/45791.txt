When editing interfaces, only Technical Component that are flagged as available for interfaces should be listed	"When editing interfaces, the dropdown with technical components does also show TCs which are not flagged as ""available for interfaces"". When you try so save such a link, you are (correctly) prevented from doing so. However, such Technical Components should not even be offered in the first place.

As that list is retrieved asynchronously, we need to add one more request parameter to the URL endpoint which allows you to request a filtered list.
