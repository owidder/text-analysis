Changing the language in edit mode causes error if the input fields have a format that depends on the localization	"Easy to reproduce with the following steps:
1) Choose a BB
2) Go to the attributes tab
3) Choose edit mode
4) Change language (de -> en)
5) A date field for example has in .de the format dd.mm.yy but in .en mm/dd/yy, the displayed date will not change it's format in an input box.
6) Change the dates to there correct format and save -> error: wrong date format.
Changing the format in the input box doesn't do an update to the correct format.

This situation appears everywhere in iteraplan while changing the language in edit mode.
It is a rather unlikely scenario but still would need a fix."
