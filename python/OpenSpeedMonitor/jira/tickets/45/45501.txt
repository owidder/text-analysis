*1. error messages*

Error messages are very general.

It would be better if you give the user a more detailed information about the error.

*2. Problems with duplicate entries*

For example, you have two information systems with the same name.
Both have an association to different business objects. 
Then Export all data and import this in an initial database (see attachment iteraplanExcelData-2.xls).
After this, one of the two information systems have both associations and the other one have no association.
