Excel Import: InformationSystemReleases and TechnicalComponentReleases with non-standard formatted names on relation sheets are not found during import	"When an Excel file contains, for example, an InformationSystemRelease named ""IS#1.0"" instead of the standard formatting ""IS # 1.0"" and that ISR is referenced in a relation sheet with the same ""wrongly"" formatted name ""IS#1.0"", the importer does not find the ISR the relation points to and consequently reports an error when the import is attempted.
This is inconsistent behaviour which might confuse users.

Reason is that release names on type sheets (SubstantialTypes and RelationshipTypes) are normalized when imported, while this is not yet done for relation sheets.

The normalization should happen on relation sheets, too."

For those newly created & incorrectly formatted IS/TC, the import of relationship sheets works fine now.
