"09/Jan/12 9:28 AM;sfe;Connections are shown for me in visio export, too.
Maybe a problem with macro permissions of the local visio installation? Macro execution is required to display the connection lines."	"16/Jan/12 3:14 PM;sfe;There are two small issues left:
In Visio Export interfaces without transported business object display an arrow even if business objects are selected for line caption.
In SVG export the ""fading out""-area of the connection line isn't placed correctly behind the line caption."	24/Jan/12 2:51 PM;lci;Everything works fine.
