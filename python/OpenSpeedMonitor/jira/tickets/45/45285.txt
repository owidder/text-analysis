Integrate Swedish localization	"Some community members started a translation of iteraplan into Swedish.

As they provided a preliminary version already, it should be properly integrated, so that Browser locale detection etc. will work for Swedish clients."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	29/Nov/11 1:18 PM	28/Dec/11 1:51 PM					language	localization								05/Dec/11 11:54 AM;sry;For preparing an email to the contributor, I did some part of the job already	"05/Dec/11 12:15 PM;sry;Re browser language detection: The contributor found a minor bug as well:
If the client browser has a preferred language that iteraplan does not support, this language is stored into the UserContext nevertheless. That means that most strings will be in English (being the default lang), but some operations like date checking etc. are performed with the client browser locale.

A second effect, which is confusing, is that the language picker does not show ""English"" when the client locale is unsupported, but ""Bulgarian"" just because it is the first entry.

For reproduction it is best to configure your browser with just one ""exotic"" preferred language, e.g. Danish, and do also check things like date validation."	08/Dec/11 5:25 PM;lci;I didn't commit the patch to PropertiesTest as it fails, since some keys are missing. I guessed it is because it's not a final version yet. 	"09/Dec/11 11:22 AM;sry;There seems to be something wrong with the HTML tags in the strings shown on the Contact page.

I'd suggest to leave this ticket in state ReadyToTest until we get a more complete translation file from the contributor."	09/Dec/11 11:53 AM;sry;Please fix the problems described in comment https://www.iteraplan.de/issues/browse/ITERAPLAN-416?focusedCommentId=11413&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-11413 and also correct the Contact page. Then let's wait for an updates file from the translators.	14/Dec/11 1:00 PM;sip;OK	"19/Dec/11 4:33 PM;sry;Re-opening, because entering productive from/to dates does not work. The check for start-date <= end-date fails in Swedish. The method DateUtils#checkDateFormat must be adapted to make that happen.

In fact, it would be even better to find a way that deals with locale-sensitive date parsing automatically, e.g. by some Apache Commons util class."	02/Jan/12 2:36 PM;sry;I updated the localization with the latest version by the contributor, and applied the Patch for PropertiesTest so that the Swedish localization is covered as well.
