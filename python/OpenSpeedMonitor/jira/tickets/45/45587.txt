Excel Import: Some errors are not reported on the UI	"Example: Error messages coming up in the {{EntityDataImporter}}, for example when a cell value is not of the expected type (see error message written in {{getCellValueOfType}}) correctly appear in the log, but are ignored by the import process.
The process continues, and might complete with a success message, while in fact some properties may not be set.

These errors should be reported on the import page as in iteraplan 3 and prevent the continuation to the next import step.

Please also investigate whether this happens in other import steps/classes."
