Wiki syntax for text attributes out of function	"In in spreadsheets reports, the wiki syntax is not resolve for text attributes.

The similar problem was documented in ITERAPLAN-987."		Bug	iteraplan PO	30/Apr/13 2:16 PM	30/Apr/13 7:10 PM					attribute	gui								"30/Apr/13 7:10 PM;sry;Now it behaves in a way that Wiki syntax is transformed to plain text, not rendered into HTML. This is consistent, but is it what the customer expected?

If yes, all fine; if no, let's discuss it, pls. I think this is the correct solution/ behaviour now.

Thx @Silvia for testing!"	"02/May/13 9:19 AM;isc;Yes, I think that is what the customer wants.
In iteraplan 2.9.1 the Wiki syntax was also transformed to plain text.
Only after the changes for iteraplan 3, Wiki syntax wasn't transformed anymore.

I think, that transformation to html is not meaningful, because it doesn't look good in a table."
