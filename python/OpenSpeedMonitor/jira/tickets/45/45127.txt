Spreadsheet reports (Information Systems): List of possible outputs decreases by marking "Include Information Systems that are connected over... [...]"	"Reports --> Spreadsheet reports --> choose: Information Systems 

Open the tag ""Rework query results"" and select: ""Include Information Systems that are connected over an Interface to Information Systems in the result set.""

After clicking on one possible output in the list, the list is reduced to three possible options: Simple list, Excel, CSV

Actually, the whole list should appear.
