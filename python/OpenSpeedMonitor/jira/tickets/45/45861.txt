Time series: Design of input form	"Scrollbar within input form should be removed.
Reduce the width of some fields, e.g. the calendar field, so that everything fits into the modal.
Vertical scrolling is ok, of course."

Please let me know if the width of the input boxes is still to large so that a horizontal scrollbar appears when there is vertical scrollbar.	11/Jul/13 6:07 PM;bra;(/) width is ok now even with FF
