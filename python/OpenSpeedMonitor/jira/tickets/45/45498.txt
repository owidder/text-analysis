Nesting Cluster Diagram: configuration and more	"see ITERAPLAN-619:

* When loading a saved query with an attribute-based coloring, the wrong tab (static coloring) is opened when one opens the color configuration window.
* Objectified values link to invalid URLs in the diagrams, which leads to an error message.
* The switch-button in the configuration interface does only switch the selected elements and not the further configuration (e.g. the coloring, the hierarchy-attribute, ...)
* Interfaces link to invalid URLs in the diagrams (using ""/informationsysteminterface/"" instead of ""/interface/""), which leads to an empty page.
