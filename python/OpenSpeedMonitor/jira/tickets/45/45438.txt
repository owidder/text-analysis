Attributes on relation between Technical Component and Infrastructure Element	"created new attribute (type: text attribute - see attachment) with name ""test"" and activated it for ""relation between technical component and infrastructure element"".

After this, I found no way to add values for this attribute either in view of technical components when choose a infrastructure element nor in view of infrastructure (other direction).

Attribute not accessible?

Tested in nightly build and own installation (2.9.1, 2.9.0) and wont work!

Have tested also relation between information system and business object: There this works after choosing a element for relationship, then saving and then going to edit-mode - not nice ... should be accessible at choosing the related object (choose object and add attribute)."
