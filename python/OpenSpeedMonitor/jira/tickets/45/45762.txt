Legend for continuous attribute color ranges contains "null" instead of a label text	"When a diagram is created with continuous coloring and ""Use color values from a range"" selected, then the legend contains two ""null"" labels. (see attachment ""legend_colorrange_null.jpg"")

To reproduce:
* In Portfolio diagram (or any other diagram with continuous range coloring) on the 2nd page, choose (for example) ""Costs"" as coloring option.
* Select ""Use color values from a range""
* Generate the diagram.
=> The legend for coloring displays ""null"" labels
