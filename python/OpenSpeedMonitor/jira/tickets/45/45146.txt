Full Text Search leads to incorrect / unexpected results	Search for special characters (e.g. _) lead to unexpected results; searches including blanks (e.g. CSA Demand EENER) lead to too large result sets. Expectation: results exactly match the entered string. Special characters should be evaluated literally, not logically. In my opinion, the user does not expect, nor need any logic here. E.ON also reported this strange search behaviour, which is also difficult to explain.		Bug	iteraplan PO	14/Sep/11 2:51 PM	21/Oct/11 9:57 AM					search									"21/Sep/11 1:47 PM;kvo;We use Lucene for searching and its behaviour/restrictions won't be changed by us.
We will improve the documentation for search, so users know about putting things in brackets etc."	"13/Oct/11 2:14 PM;sry;Simple Validation has been added to search boxes (except top right field) to show a warning when special characters are entered.
The documentation at https://www.iteraplan.de/wiki/display/iteraplan/Global+search has been extended."	"20/Oct/11 1:28 PM;tdi;Searching for one or more blanks leads to error message.Blanks are not forbidden. Why not strip the search string of any leading / trailing whitespace?

Tested for building block ""interfaces""."	20/Oct/11 1:30 PM;tdi;another small issue: in the error message it says "weitere details finden sie in der online-dokumentatio". Hier fehlt noch ein "n" hinten.	20/Oct/11 1:31 PM;tdi;screenshot regarding last comment	"20/Oct/11 1:59 PM;sry;Hmm, I believe an error message on an whitespace-only query is the better option. If we strip the leading/trailing spaces away, it gives you an empty result set. For the global search this may be ok, but for the building block overview pages it seems counter-intuitive. That ""search query"" is hard to spot and users might wonder why they can't see their building blocks.

Other searches with leading/trailing whitespace work fine, so I believe there's nothing to change."	"20/Oct/11 3:48 PM;kvo;Handling of Whitespaces are ok.
Showing error ok. Message ok."	"20/Oct/11 4:33 PM;sry;After a short chat with Tobias a new idea came up how blank-only strings can be handled elegantly.
Reopening to implement that idea."	21/Oct/11 9:57 AM;sfe;Works fine: blank only strings are simply ignored and the search result is equal to that of an unconstrained search.
