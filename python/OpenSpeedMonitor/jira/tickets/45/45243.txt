Improve GUI validation for attribute type input fields	"Currently:
1) attribute names are marked as invalid if they contain "":""
2) the unit field for number attributes cannot contain ""#""
3) the lower and upper bound fields are not checked if they represent a number
4) range values are also not validated

Should be:
1) attribute names can contain "":"" as they are not hierarchical elements
3) the unit field may contain any character
4) lower, upper bound and range value fields should be validated "		Bug	iteraplan PO	07/Nov/11 2:53 PM	25/Nov/11 3:55 PM					attribute	number								16/Nov/11 10:48 AM;vsh;Any other input fields should remain unaffected.	"17/Nov/11 11:52 AM;bsi;Range values are validated against letters or special characters before saving. But another problemm occurs: if user defined ranges are set properly, then once the attribute is edited again the range values are marked as invalid.

Repro:

1. set user defined number ranges of a number attribute
2. save the the attribute
3. edit the attribute again

Result:

1. All set values are marked as invalid
2. Furthermore after deleting one of the ""invalid"" values, all set values are deleted too but the input fields remain"	24/Nov/11 4:58 PM;sry;This is also integrated in release 2.9.1 (changesets up to now).	25/Nov/11 3:55 PM;sfe;seems to work fine
