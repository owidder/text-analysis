Missing standard value in bulk updates	"It seems no standard value is available for updates of relations to other building blocks (see issue 1 on the screenshot in attachement). If this behaviour is expected at least the corresponding pull-down menu should be removed/hidden. 

Another issue (nr. 2 on the screenshot) is the possition of the pull-down menus in the right coloumn which seems to be quite random. Much better would be consistent beginning and end.

Is there a reason for this or is it just a slip to be corrected?	27/Mar/12 12:54 PM;sry;fine. The only strange thing is that "Forbidden" mouse pointer over the drop-down symbol of the searchable edit boxes.  But that's the same in normal BB details pages, so ok here.
