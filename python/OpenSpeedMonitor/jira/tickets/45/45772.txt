Custom Dashboards: Diagrams in Custom Dashboards Do Not Include their Legend(s)	The legends for the diagrams explaining applied colors are not displayed next to the diagrams in the custom dashboards. Legends about the abbreviations are contained though. I think I have a hard time interpreting the different colors in several diagrams of a dashboard so that I would need to rely on a legend. Therefore, the legends should be included for every diagram in a dashboard.

I think both approaches (w/ or w/o legend) make sense.
Other suggestions?"	20/Jun/13 3:42 PM;isc;This ticket is solved by the ticket ITERAPLAN-1554.
