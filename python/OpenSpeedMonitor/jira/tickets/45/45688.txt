I have checked that there are no calls to mutators of BuildingBlockType that may cause an update query that was silently dismissed as long as mutable="false" was applied to the mapping.	"03/May/13 6:14 PM;bra;only templates for Constants.ALL_TYPES_FOR_DISPLAY, because only for those there are graphics. 
counter-example: in a template for BB ""transport"" or ""business mapping"" one could not write a graphics definition, only static text. 

UI spec as talked about today with WFr (ask him!) 
in screen administraton > templates add 
- list of existing templates with colums name of bb type, description (un-wikied if based on wiki text, truncated), icons for edit and delete 
- dropdown and create button for bb types without template 
- tabbed pane for template with 
  - tab template text: text with wiki macros, see 4.0 editor, but degree of edit support to be discussed for 3.1. 
  - tab preview (use all graphics in template def, use the result set of the underlying graphics definitions, even if this definition is ignored in regular use) 
  - tab description (OPEN, check with sponsoring text and SRy: Wiki required? or plain multiline text?) 
  - save, cancel buttons top right 

flow: 
initial: only list of templates 
action edit template or create new template show template panel and disable list and dropdown/button 
action save/cancel return to init 

user can navigate away from unsafed edits, losing them, as in other cases of edits in text boxes in i3. 

decision: no copy of templates needed, user can copy contents by clipboard or text editor. 

decision: no modal ""window"" for template edit panel, because combination of modal and scrolling problematic."	03/May/13 6:28 PM;bra;add a short hint on what buildingblocks are used to populate the preview of the template	08/May/13 4:57 PM;bra;please have a short look on the db-migration while testing	"27/May/13 5:04 PM;isc;The implementation is so far well.
I have found only one thing at the dropdown list for Building Block Types (page document templates). The choice for “Business Mapping” is not necessary. Is it possible to remove it?
