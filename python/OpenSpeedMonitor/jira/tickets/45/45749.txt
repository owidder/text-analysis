Actions on search result list cause the search to be reset	"All of the actions available to be performed on a search result cause the active search to be reset and all buildingblocks being displayed.

To reproduce;
* navigate to the BP Overview page
* execute a fulltextsearch on BPs => search is executed and results are reduced to matching ones
* switch to tree-view
=> search is reset and all BBs are displayed as result

the same happens if one changes sort-order of the results, moves columns, adds columns, removes columns, etc."		Bug	iteraplan PO	05/Jun/13 6:30 PM	27/Jun/13 4:33 PM					3.0.5-candidate	gui	search							27/Jun/13 4:33 PM;sfe;seems fine
