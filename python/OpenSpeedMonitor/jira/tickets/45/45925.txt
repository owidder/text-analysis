Content of an information flow diagram overlaps with the legends when displayed in a custom dashboard	Unlike the svg-export of an info flow diagram the "custom dashboard version" suffers from overlap of content and legends (see attached images). This behaviour is independent of the amount of building blocks (tested with 3, 9, 12, 25) and browser type (FF 22, IE 10).
