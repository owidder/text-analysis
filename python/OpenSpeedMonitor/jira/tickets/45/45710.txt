Excel import: new informationFlow can overwrite existing associations without warning	"When exporting the model in Excel, adding a new information flow and reimporting the new data can cause changes in the previously existing model.

This happens when the same informationSystemInterface is used but different informationSystemReleases. iteraplan then takes the two informationSystemReleases that were added last.

+Example:+
{quote}
direction | iteraplan_InformationSystemInterfaceID | businessObject | informationSystemInterface | informationSystemRelease1 | informationSystemRelease2

exported xls row
FIRST_TO_SECOND | 292 | Accounting entry | TX records[ SAP Fi-P10 # 6.0,Treasury # 1.0] | SAP Fi-P10 # 6.0 | Treasury # 1.0

newly added row
FIRST_TO_SECOND |  | Invoice | TX records[ SAP Fi-P10 # 6.0,Treasury # 1.0] | SAP Fi-P10 # 6.0 | Solvency check # 1.1

2nd export (after importing new data)
FIRST_TO_SECOND | 292 | Invoice | TX records[ SAP Fi-P10 # 6.0,Solvency check # 1.1] | SAP Fi-P10 # 6.0 | Solvency check # 1.1
FIRST_TO_SECOND | 292 | Accounting entry | TX records[ SAP Fi-P10 # 6.0,Solvency check # 1.1] | SAP Fi-P10 # 6.0 | Solvency check # 1.1

Treasury is gone ...

The information provided during import do not state any warnings about that. It's the same as if a new information flow between SAP Fi-P10 and Treasury was added."		Bug	iteraplan PO	13/May/13 5:04 PM	19/Jul/13 2:09 PM					excel	import								23/May/13 6:47 PM;sry;Is currently being addressed in the other ticket	"23/Jun/13 10:55 PM;jme@iteratec.de;hmm. works for me.
nightly build from the 21.06.2013. "	"24/Jun/13 9:35 AM;dne;does not work for me... nighly build from today + xls ;)
the newly added row simply isn't added - at least no old data is altered"	"24/Jun/13 10:28 AM;jme@iteratec.de;@Daniel:
Have you waited until the static model is synchronized with the elastic model?"	"24/Jun/13 10:39 AM;dne;nope... I have checked it again and the problem described in the ticket still persists. Treasury is gone again.

353	FIRST_TO_SECOND	293	Accounting entry	TX records[SAP Fi-P10 # 6.0,Solvency check # 1.0,293]	SAP Fi-P10 # 6.0	Solvency check # 1.0

"	"24/Jun/13 11:09 AM;jme@iteratec.de;We have pinned down the problem:
if you add an additional information flow between 
ISA -> ISC
and link it to an interface between
ISA -> ISB
then the interface is updated according to the last linked information flow.
This means, that the interface links ISA -> ISC after the import.

The import enforces a consistent model.

Maybe a warning or error during the import process would be good."	"16/Jul/13 11:00 AM;jme@iteratec.de;Decision by Steffen:
add a Warning"	"16/Jul/13 11:04 AM;jme@iteratec.de;under the following circumstances an error is issued (during the validation phase):

for each Interface: check all attached InformationFlows
if at least one of the left or one of the right attached InformationSystems differ
an error is raised.

Result of the error: the import process is stopped. 


Error message:
""The Interface \""{0}\"" has InformationFlows attached that differ in the InformationSystems. All InformationFlows of one Interface have to have the same pair of InformationSystems as endpoints."""	16/Jul/13 11:35 AM;sry;Does that warning appear _before_ the changes are written to the DB? A warning after the fact would not help that much any more.	"17/Jul/13 10:14 AM;jme@iteratec.de;Currently I can only issue an error during the validation phase. A warning is not (yet) possible.

Refactored the code. An Error is issued and the import process is stopped in the validation phase."	19/Jul/13 2:09 PM;lba;(/) An error message appears at import -> import fails
