InformationFlow: Cannot create same InformationFlow with different output format	"When I create an InformationFlow, say in Visio format, and choose a different format afterwards, e.g. PDF, and press the Generate-Button, nothing happens.

Only if I jump to another page (iteraplan start page) and back to the InformationFlow it is possible to create the visualization.

After a refresh (F5) the buttons are working again."
