Delusive error message appears when elastic (meta)model is not yet initialized	"When certain pages are opened and an action is performed quickly, before elastic (meta)model has finished loading, a the following error page/message appears:
""The query framework has experienced a fatal error (error code: {0}).""  (see attachment ""queryFatalError.jpg"")

This can be very frightening for users (and even developers), because it says ""fatal error"". This evokes the impression, that the application and/or the data is corrupted. But after waiting a few seconds, navigating back and performing the action again, everything is working all right (when the query framework has finished loading).

This can happen on the following pages:

* Excel import/export
* Nesting cluster diagram


Possible solutions:

* Provide a clear(er) error message about what happened (and that it's not critical), and tell the user to try again in a few seconds.

* Wait for the query framework (thread) until loading has finished and/or give an appropriate feedback in the UI.
If waiting for the query framework should be implemented, a less error-prone high-level approach like java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch may be appropriate.
