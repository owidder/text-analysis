Expand the http-service to include additional parameter	"The http-service for graphics must be extended to include parameter for ""different basic sets""
Caution: Diagrams could contains two or more ""basic sets"". Determine the varied basic sets by indexes.
Example: Landscape Diagram

Detailed description follows.
"	45668	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	18/Apr/13 2:33 PM	12/Jun/13 1:36 PM					dashboard									"10/May/13 11:17 AM;isc;The http service for creating diagrams/saved queries (generateSavedQuery) was expanded.
The following, optional parameters could be used: 

*queryReferenceId* (expected an int)
If there is specified a reference ID (queryRefID), the saved Query (diagram) is loaded with the result from the referenced saved Query (from a tabular reporting).
The BBType of the result from the query reference and from the diagram must be the same. Otherwise you get an exception.
The replacement of the result works only with the old graphic generating system. The VBB based system is currently incompatible. 
The replacement works with following graphics:
•	Landscape Diagram
•	Cluster Diagram
•	Information Flow Diagram
•	Portfolio Diagram
•	Master plan Diagram
•	Bar and Pie Chart

Graphics which are not supported to replace the result:
•	Nesting Cluster Diagram
•	Timeline graphic

*nakedExport* (expected an boolean)
This parameter based on an existing function. With this parameter you can decide if the graphic is generated with corners and some additional information or not.
This function works not for VBB based graphics and not for composite diagrams.

*Size (width and height)* (expected an double)
With the parameter “width” and “height” it is possible to control the size of a graphic. Both parameters are optional. If width or height is set - the parameter that is not defined is set automatically into the right ratio. If both parameters are set - the value for the height is ignored and is set auto-matically into the right ratio to the width.
This function works not for VBB based graphics.

for svg to enable auto resizing we need the viewBox set and we should not have the display:table css rule on the .viewBoxPanel class"	24/May/13 2:19 PM;sry;Bernhard, are your tests complete? The auto-scaling should be subject of another ticket - Ingo has already put a reminder note into ITERAPLAN-1501.	"28/May/13 10:10 AM;bra;(/) naked export works
(x) sizing works for all charts except the barchart. The barchart is not rendered with the specified size regardless if height or width is set."	"28/May/13 11:23 AM;bra;regarding the diagram-resizing:
* to enable the browser resizing svg graphics on customDashboards the Container containing the chart to be resized needs to have an explicitly set or inherited width (e.g. via style=""width: 100%""). Unfortunately this is not the case with tables.
* furthermore the container containing the chart needs to have the display css-attribute set to 'block'

this also works for tables if they have the ""width: 100%"" attribute set.
however the xwiki to html generation process renders tables to automatically grow with their content (default html behavior).

A possible solution for this would be to create a css-rule that applies the ""width: 100%"" attribute on all tables within a dashboard (this has of course influence on the behavior of tables that are not used to layout different charts in a grid but to display data...)

Furthermore the svg graphics are not allowed to have neither height nor width set explicitly, but they need to have the viewBox-attribute set to ""0 0 <w> <h>"""	12/Jun/13 1:36 PM;bra;works fine
