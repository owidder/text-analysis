As they were used in the same way in all graphical reporting configuration views, I modified all of these to use the new tile. I hope this does not disturb your current developments. The IDs and everything related to formatting did not change. Please drop me a line if this broke something.	15/Mar/12 3:05 PM;kvo;All new UI-Related changes should be logged into ITERAPLAN-592
