GUI and function for Dashboard-Templates	"On the page ""Document Templates"" the function for the creation of the Dashboard-Templates should be integrate.

The creation of the Dashboard-templates should be implemented as an XWiki-syntax based solution. Therefor we need an input area. As first version it should be implemented with a simple text area for the user input. This do not contains support for own diagram macros or xwiki syntax elements. To get a fast result and to give the user the chance to see the graphic output, it should be implemented a preview function. This means, in dependence to this ticket we need the implementation of  the ticket ITERAPLAN-1526.
