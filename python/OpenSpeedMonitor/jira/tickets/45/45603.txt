NullPointerException in Excel import when wrong cell formats are set	"See {{EntityDataImporter#convertCellValue}}.
When numbers are expected, but another cell format is set, the getter for the cell value returns null, which leads to a NullPointerException. A fix for this particular issue was applied for iteraplan 4 already by expecting a possible null value and giving it special treatment (see same method in trunk).
"		Bug	iteraplan PO	11/Jan/13 4:18 PM	27/Jun/13 3:56 PM					3.0.5-candidate	excel	format	import						14/Jan/13 10:01 AM;sfe;Another, related improvement: the method {{getStringCellValue}} in {{ExcelUtils}} should be used in {{getEnumPropertyValue}} of {{EntityDataImporter}} similar to the usage in {{getStringPropertyValue}}, since enumeration literals are represented as text in the Excel file. This avoids possible problems with enumeration literals consisting of only numbers.	"18/Apr/13 11:33 AM;sfe;The original issue here was fixed in Changeset [19801|https://iteraplan.iteratec.de/projects/iteraplan/changeset/19801] of ITERAPLAN-1437.
The improvement mentioned in my comment above was not yet implemented, though."	21/Jun/13 2:24 PM;svo;The method {{getStringCellValue}} is now used. Was tested using enums with literals consisting of only numbers manually, however an integration into the unit test would require a change of the test metamodel and thus was not performed.
