Display error in filter-query forms of loaded Landscape diagrams	"Example:
# Go to Landscape Diagram.
# Choose Information Systems as content.
# Click ""Filter"" for content and add query extension ""Properties of assigned business mappings"".
# In the query form select Property ""name"" for Business Processes to be equal (operator) to an arbitrarily selected entry of the according dropdown choice.
# Send query and use results.
# Choose arbitrary column and row associations.
# Save diagram.
# Reset diagram form (context actions: reset).
# Load the saved diagram and change to the content filter page again.

=> Result as in attached screenshot: The chosen value for ""name"" of the Business Processes is not displayed and the dropdown box disabled. The query result itself is still correct, though.

When changing the operator, the form is refreshed and shows the value again."		Bug	iteraplan PO	12/Mar/13 1:59 PM	30/Dec/15 2:32 PM					diagram	landscape	queryform
