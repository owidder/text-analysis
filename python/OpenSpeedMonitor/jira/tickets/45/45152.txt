Popup for attribute details does not show full attribute description	Go to applications, attributes, look for some arbitrary enum attribute and click on details. Popup is displayed incl. attribute description, but only some values are described here. In popup, subsequent attribute values are cut off. Is there some limit in the popup size? The bug occurs with both IE and Firefox.		Bug	iteraplan PO	16/Sep/11 12:28 PM	22/Sep/11 2:09 PM					usability									22/Sep/11 2:09 PM;agu;This is not a bug. The description of the enumeration attributes shows only the assigned values. We don't want to show all possible values, because in some cases the popup will be bigger than the screen size. For example if the enumeration has 100 possible values.
