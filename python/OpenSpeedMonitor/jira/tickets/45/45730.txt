Implement administration UI for DateIntervals	"We need a UI to create, edit and delete Date Interval entities. It should categorized into the Administration menu and depend on the attribute management permission.
For each Date Interval, I want to set its Name and select from existing date attributes for start and end. 

Colour should be omitted for now, as it is now evaluated by masterplan diagrams yet. It would only confuse users."	45634	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	23/May/13 10:10 PM	26/Jun/13 11:08 AM					attribute	dateinterval	maintenance							"13/Jun/13 1:45 PM;sry;I think we don't need an explicit Permission for managing DateIntervals. Instead, please tie it to the existing Attribute (Type) Management permission.
That is, please remove {{DATEINTERVAL}} from {{TypeOfFunctionalPermission}} again. I guess that this is also the reason why some test are failing right now - our sample data set does not include that additional permission. "	"20/Jun/13 1:51 PM;lba;Please check if users without the functional permissions of attribute type can edit the date intervals.
They shouldn't be able to."	"20/Jun/13 2:43 PM;bra;(x) one is able to view the details of dateinterval attributes even without permission if one knows the url.
(x) furthermore one can even create new dateintervals by just clicking on the ""create new"" link in the context menu that is shown on the overview page stating the ""You are not entitled to access this page"" message."	25/Jun/13 12:48 PM;bra;(x) if a user does not have the permission to configure attributetypes navigates (by knowing the url) to the detail page of a dateinterval, the dateinterval details are presented to the user. Those details should not be shown at all. Instead he should be presented the message 'You are not entitled to access this page.'	"25/Jun/13 1:36 PM;sry;(y) Andrea showed me that the date interval detail page is visible for users who know that URL, and we agreed that this is ok. It does not leak any sensitive information and may be useful as a reference.

Did you see any other issues, or is testing completed with that decision?"	25/Jun/13 1:50 PM;sry;Pls translate DATE_AT_NOT_SHARING_BBTYPE in the German localization!	"26/Jun/13 11:08 AM;bra;if different behavior of the ui is tolerated here this is ok.

(?) we may disallow creating dateintervals with the same date attribute being used as start and end date.
(?) what should happen if a date attribute used by a dateinterval is removed from a BBType so that the dateintervals start and end attribute no longer share at least one BBType?

I did the translation. It would be nice if you could crosscheck it."	26/Jun/13 4:15 PM;sry;Merci!
