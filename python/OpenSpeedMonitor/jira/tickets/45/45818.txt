Line Chart: Unnecessary error page if I forget an input	"In the second configuration step for line charts:
It is always necessary to specify a start and an end date.
If I omit an indication, I come every time to an error page. It would be better when I get the information on the same page where I have forgotten the input.
It would be even better, if you could omit the end date (as optional feature). 
If there is no end date indicates, it should be used the current date.
This would also correspond to the solution from version 4.0.

In that case the current date is set as last date.	16/Jul/13 9:08 PM;sry;Is this ready to be tested, or will you do more here?	17/Jul/13 2:58 PM;smo;Fixed, except the content of the empty error box which has been moved to ITERAPLAN-1767.	17/Jul/13 3:08 PM;sry;Good, thx.
