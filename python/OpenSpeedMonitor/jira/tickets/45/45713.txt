Missing relation "used by information systems" in spreadsheet report	The spreadsheet report for information systems shows only uses relation, not used by relation for information systems. 		Bug	iteraplan PO	14/May/13 11:06 AM	03/Jul/13 5:57 PM					3.0.5-candidate	excel								"25/Jun/13 10:50 PM;sry;Add the missing column. This should be a simple fix.

Pls do also check whether all columns for other self-relationships (successor-predecessor, specializes-specialized by etc.) are in place as well."	28/Jun/13 11:21 AM;svo;It appears that the coloumn is not only omitted during generation of the excel report, but there are not even constants and names defined for this relationship. The same is the case for the "used-by"-relationship of technical components.	28/Jun/13 12:11 PM;svo;The problem existed for all USES-elements, for InfrastructureElements not even the base component was printed to the report. This has now been changed, but for the headers appropriate names have to be defined for all localization; constants referring to these names are newly defined in {{ExcelConstants}}.	28/Jun/13 12:17 PM;svo;For TechnicalComponents, the the "used by..." relationship is not displayed in the web interface either, but it is displayed for {{InformationSystems}} and {{InfrastructureElements}}	28/Jun/13 6:02 PM;svo;Presentation of Self-References (Uses/UsedBy, Specialization/Generalization, Successor/Predecessor) is now consistent in Excel-Reports. They were moved to the section of common attributes and relationships for consistency reasons and are treated as such. Both directions are printed to the spreadsheet for each of them. Affected Building Blocks: {{InformationSystem}}, {{BusinessObject}}, {{TechnicalComponent}}, {{InfrastructureElement}} Instead of the constants defined in {{ExcelConstants}}, the already defined but unused constants in {{Constants}} are used to identify the String values. A new constant {{general.generalization}} was introduced and needs to be translated in the localizations other than german and english.	03/Jul/13 5:57 PM;gph;Looks good. IE, TC and IS spreadsheets show correct "uses" and "used by" relations.	04/Jul/13 11:27 AM;sry;Thx, nice!
