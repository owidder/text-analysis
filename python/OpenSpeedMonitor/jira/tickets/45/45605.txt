Interfaces without names are not exported with the Excel export - this means staging and restore produces an incomplete model	"A name for interfaces is not required in iteraplan 3.x.
Interfaces without names are not with the Excel export exports in iteraplan 3.x.
Data backup with the Excel export and the migration of ietraplan 3.x to 4.0 is not safe.

Interfaces without names should also be exported with the Excel export."		Bug	iteraplan PO	13/Jan/13 3:06 PM	21/Jun/13 6:18 PM					excel	export								"21/May/13 4:34 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Interfaces without name cannot be matched correctly with the corresponding information flow.

Explanation:
Consider two interfaces without name with the endpoints ISA and ISB.
Name of each Interface would be: [ISA,ISB]
(The information in the brackets are added during the export)

The matching with the information flow is done by the interface name. Which is not unique in this setting."	"21/May/13 4:41 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Solution:

the information added to the interface name is extended by the interface id.
in the given example the name would be:
[ISA,ISB,33]
and
[ISA,ISB,46]
(if the interfaces have the id 33 and 46).
This ensures that the name is unique and all necessary information about the endpoints are still in place."	"28/May/13 12:23 AM;jme@iteratec.de;The missing export should have been detected within the test class
DiffBuilderWithIdenticalModelTest

The differences are detected right but there is no assertion that forces the test to fail.

"	"28/May/13 12:27 AM;jme@iteratec.de;All interfaces in the test data have no name.

Added a business object to be transfered by one of the interfaces.

The business object is part of a newly created business domain."	"28/May/13 12:28 AM;jme@iteratec.de;Added an assertion that makes sure that the test 
testWorkbookRoundtrip
fails if there are any differences in the original model compared to the exported/imported model."	"30/May/13 12:59 PM;jme@iteratec.de;An interface with the name ""TEST"" has now the enhanced name
TEST [ISR1,ISR2,ID]
with 
ISR1 = name of the left side information system
ISR2 = name of the right side information system
ID = persistent id of the information system

The ID extension is new in 3.1.

There are many ways how to strip the technical appendix from the enhanced name to derive the real name.

In 3.0.4 a direct matching with the appendix was used (""last index of [ISR1,ISR2]"").

But it is better to ignore the last bracket altogether. This allows the user to define new interfaces without the need to follow strict technical rules (and guess some ID).

E.g. the user can define the following interface in Excel:

ID NAME
NEW1
NEW2[MODIFICAION A]
[ANONYMOUS]

The enhanced name is solely used for the matching between the Interfaces and the Information Flows.

The user has to specify at least an appendix. Or else the import process reports an error (""name"" not null).
Two new anonymous interfaces with exact the same appendix produce an error during the import process as well (uniqueness constraint).
"	"30/May/13 12:59 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Where it gets interesting is when there is a ""["" in the name of a connected information system.

Say information systems ""IS [A]"" and ""IS [B]"" are connected via the interface ""MY_IF"" (with the id 4711).

The extended name, used in Excel, would then be:
MY_IF[IS [A],IS[B], 4711]

If you now change the name of the interface in the Excel-file (e.g. MY_IF_NEW) and import the file you would get as name for the interface:
MY_IF_NEW(IS [A],IS

(the regex removes everything from the last ""["" to the end of the name).

Solution: 
When renaming a interface delete the technical extension manually.
So the new name should be:
MY_IF_NEW

not
MY_IF_NEW[IS [A],IS[B], 4711]"	"30/May/13 1:28 PM;jme@iteratec.de;ToDo:
Add JUnit test with creation of interfaces, ..."	"17/Jun/13 9:37 AM;jme@iteratec.de;Unit-Testing:

Created DiffBuilderWithChangedModelTest:
Tested Issues;
- Change Direction of Information Flow (for named and anonymous interfaces)
- Add/Remove/Change BO transported over an Information Flow (for named and anonymous interfaces)
- Change anonymous interface to named interface
- Change named interface to anonymous interface



"	21/Jun/13 6:18 PM;svo;integration in unit tests ok, works according to description. Data stays consistent unless an interface is changed by excel import and the IS contain a [ character. In that case only the name of the interface is changed incorrectly, though. This can be prevented if the name extension containing IS names and ID is removed from the excel file prior to import.
