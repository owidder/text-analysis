The Excel Export does not work with customizations 	"If you change the ""ApplicationResources.properties"" the export does not work anymore.
For Example I have change several names of building blocks and glossary entries. 

When I start the excel export I get the following error message: ""The query framework has experianced a fatal error (error code: {0}).""
Sometimes it works, but I just get a default metamodel.

But now I think that is no problem with the customizations.
I get this error only after the first login in iteraplan. To a later time, this error doesnâ€™t occur. I suppose that iteraplan needs several time to load the data. "	30/Apr/13 2:43 PM;sry;Yes, iteraplan needs some time (depending of number BBs in the DB) to build the in-memory elastic representation, before Excel bulk operations work. This transformation is triggered by a login, or after some data has been modified (with a little delay)
