Systematic permissions for import and export	"At the moment, there are three permissions in iteraplan which relate to only one menu entry:
* Ausführen von Export (Excel)
* Ausführen von Import (XMI)
* Ausführen von Export (XMI)  _(these two for XMI were originally created for the pre-elastic XMI im/export implementation)_

There is no permission for performing Excel imports, though. And finally, Excel and XMI imports share the same UI anyway.

To improve this situation, these permissions should be consolidated into:
* *Run EA Data Imports* (by renaming the existing permission)
* *Run EA Data Exports* (by merging both existing permissions and renaming)

If either of these two permissions is granted, the {{Export/Import}} menu entry shall be visible. Depending on which of these permissions is granted, the Export/Import page shall show only the export section, only the import section, or both sections. The same applies to the time series import/ export operations.

Consider these changes for migrations, too!
There still the hidden dialogs for pre-elastic Excel and XMI import around. Change their permissions check so that they rely on the new Import permission as well.
