Fix permission-check for watches	"In the menu, there is ""Watched Elements"" shown, even when the user does not have the appropriate permissions.

On the overview-pages for e.g. the information systems, the actions ""Watch"" and ""Watches"" are shown, even when the user does not have the appropriate permissions.

The "Watched Elements" are still there, but I think that's correct, since a user should be able to see the elements he's subscribed to.
