Information Flow Diagram don't save selected Information Systems in a saved configuration	"Open an Information System (maybe Account-Sys RB # 3.1)
Go to the Tab ""Visualisation""
Create a Visualisation with the Content: ""Information Flow Diagram""
After that, click on the Button ""Configure""
Now, the Information Flow Diagram configuration (2nd page) is open and one can see that there are only few Information Systems selected.
Now save this configuration and go back to the first configuration step. Load the saved visualization again. Now, the configuration contains all information systems.
The selected Information Systems which I want wasn't saved.

Expected behavior: The selected information systems coming from the context visualization are saved within the configuration of the saved query.
