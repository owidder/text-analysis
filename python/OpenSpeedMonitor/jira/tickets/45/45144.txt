"new release" functionality incomplete?	"iteraplan trunk provides a different ""new release"" implementation. Expectation:
* Direct properties, attributes, relations, permissions will be copied. 
* Business mappings will be copied.
* Hierarchy link to superordinated application will be copied.
* Deep copy of sub-applications: currently removed, but this functional change should be discussed first!
* Deep copy of interfaces & transported business objects: currently removed, but this functional change should be discussed first!
