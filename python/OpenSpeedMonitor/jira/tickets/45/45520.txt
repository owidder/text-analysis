Filtering Available for Interfaces with String leads to error	Filtering in TechnicalComponents - "Available for Interfaces" with a string leads to error, which persists throughout the session		Bug	iteraplan PO	03/May/12 9:43 AM	04/May/12 1:30 PM														"03/May/12 9:44 AM;kvo;ErrorMessage:
""java.lang.String cannot be cast to java.lang.Boolean"""	03/May/12 10:55 AM;lci;The error is caused by the fact that the input string is forwarded directly to Hibernate, where only the strings "true" and "false" can be handled. Since both warning the user beforehand and deactivating the freetext field for this very attribute would require some very specific code, I decided to wrap the exception and let it through.
