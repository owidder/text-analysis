Also offer Pagination when using filters & search	"Within BuildingBlock Overview after using a filter (saved tabular report-query) all elements are shown. It should be possible to also step through multiple pages. Pagination helpful, especially with many results.
Additionally after using fulltext search the pagination is not working. Instead all elements are shown. This bug should be removed as well."
