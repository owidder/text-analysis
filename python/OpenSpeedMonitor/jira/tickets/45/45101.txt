Missing an appropriate error message while creating a new attribute	If a user wants to create a new attribute and does not choose any of the available options the generall error message is shown ("An error occurred while processing your request..."). A message like "Please choose one of the available types" on the same page would make more sense and is more user friedly :)		Improvement	iteraplan PO	29/Aug/11 1:52 PM	14/Sep/11 12:55 PM					attribute	error	message	new					Enterprise Edition Build-v2.9.SNAPSHOT-r14167 (2011-08-29-04-32-37), nightly	13/Sep/11 3:48 PM;uba;Functionality works	"14/Sep/11 12:55 PM;mba;Tested the creation of new attributes without having selected an AT.
 => Behaviour as expected: process rejected, expressive error message is displayed which asks user to select an AT.
Only issue: Bulgarian error message contains many '?'s (like many other keys in the resources_bg.properties) => separate issue??
all other languages OK"
