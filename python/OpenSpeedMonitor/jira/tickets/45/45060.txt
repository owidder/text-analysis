Switch between modules of iteraplan without loss of the selection of building blocks	It should be possible to switch from one module of iteraplan to another, while retaining the building blocks selected in the first module. For example, consider a scenario where the user has defined a complex Tabular Report and wishes to use the resulting set of building blocks for an Information Flow Diagram.

"31/Aug/11 3:40 PM;sfe;When using the results of an iteraQl-query in, for example, an information flow diagram, and then saving the diagram configuration to load it again, not always all of the previously selected results are included.
This happens if the original result set contained information systems which don't fit the ""standard query"" used for information systems upon initialisation, meaning if they have another status than ""current"" or their runtime period doesn't fit the current day."
