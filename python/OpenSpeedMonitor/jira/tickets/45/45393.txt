Enum attribute can't be saved after trying to add an already existing attribute value	"To reproduce (using bank data):

1. Open the attribute ""Complexity""
2. Edit
3. Try to add and save the new attribute value ""high"" => Error because the value already exists. Everything alright so far
4. Change the new value to ""high2"" or anything else and try to save.

Result:
{quote}
The following errors occurred:
This element cannot be saved successfully anymore. This may be due to the following reasons:

1. The element has been modified by another user.
2. Attributes have been modified by another user or in the dialog Attributes.
3. Explicit permissions have been modified by another user or in the dialog Object-related Permissions.
4. Associated elements have been deleted by another user or in the corresponding dialog.

To continue, please click Close or Cancel, or clear the current session.

It should be possible to save at this point, since no actual changes by another user were made."		Bug	iteraplan PO	01/Mar/12 10:32 AM	30/Dec/15 2:11 PM					attribute
