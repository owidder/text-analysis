Interface direction in ExcelImport	Import the Interface direction in Excel, which is currently not supported		New Feature	iteraplan PO	01/Sep/11 1:24 PM	20/Sep/11 2:27 PM					excel	import								15/Sep/11 1:40 PM;agu;I can not reproduce. Could you provide a Test case?	19/Sep/11 11:23 AM;mre;Test case	19/Sep/11 12:39 PM;agu;fixed.	19/Sep/11 2:33 PM;vsh;The regexp solution is flawed: for the direction the user can enter any text containing '\-' or '\->' like '5\-4' or 'nonsense \-> nonsense' and still the direction is set without even a warning message because the pattern is found. A better solution will be to except only the predefined string representations for the direction. The only problematic case appears to be \-> which requires to be encoded as '\-> in Excel. A better solution will be to only omit the ' from the input value and set the direction accordingly.	19/Sep/11 2:41 PM;vsh;There should also be warning message in case the direction string doesn't match the predefined values.	20/Sep/11 10:55 AM;agu;Thanks for your comments. I added your improvements.	20/Sep/11 2:27 PM;vsh;Now it's OK.
