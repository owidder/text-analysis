Error when cancelling download of XMI-Export bundle	"When the user clicks on export button, but cancels the download dialog and then clicks on the export button again, there is an error and the download does not start. Again clicking on export results in correct output. The error seems to show itself differently depending on browser.
Internally an error happens even without the second click."
