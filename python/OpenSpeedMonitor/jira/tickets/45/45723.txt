Nesting Cluster: A Report that has an Attribute with the character "/" can't be used in a group	"This is most likely a problem with the parsing. A ""/"" is not foreseen as a character that a name of Relationship/Attribute/BuildingBlock can contain.
Normally a ""/"" instructs the parser that the following characters are a relationship name.
Normally to resolve this issue you have to rewrite parts of the iteraQl(-parser) and introduce a new rule that especially parses attribute names. 
Maybe problems with the objectify-modifier could occur but I am not sure of that.
