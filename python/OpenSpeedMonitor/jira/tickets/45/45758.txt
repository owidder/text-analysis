Reenable the Interchange from iteraQl to other Reports	In iteraplan 2.9 it was possible to execute an iteraQl query and use the query results for diagrams or mass update. The feature is currently not available in iteraplan 3.0, due to the usage of elasticEAM as an iteraQl engine and its incompatibility with the Building Blocks of the iteraplan 3.0 model. The feature should be enabled again, but only for non-synthetic query results, and only if the results are a list (come from a Universal Type Query). In the cases of synthetic Universal Types (e.g. objectify) and Relationship End Queries, no transition to other Reports or Bulk Updates should be offered.

level selection is still visible even if only informationsystems on the first level are selected.
if i make a selection of informationsystems that are only on level 1 and take them over to the landscape diagram as content, the dropdown for the levels to display is shown. The dropdown disappears if a selection on the column or row association is performed

UPDATE:
(x) this leads to errors if someone select an invalid level (e.g. only IS on level 1 selected, but user selects level 2) and tries to generate the diagram"	12/Jun/13 2:49 PM;bra;sorry for rejecting this, but as stated in the update to comment 1 the user may end up being unable to generate the report without having an easy/intuitive way recovering from the error	14/Jun/13 11:58 AM;bra;(/) works	16/Jul/13 9:21 PM;sry;great, thx!
