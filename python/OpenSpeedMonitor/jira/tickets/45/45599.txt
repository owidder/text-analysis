Authentication by Atlassian CROWD	"A customer has ordered a new feature for iteraplan to authenticate users via CROWD.

Identified functional requirements by Carsten Tekaat and Steffen Ryll:
* User and role should be assigned by CROWD
* Role and rights should be assigned by iteraplan
* If a CROWD-authenticated user is trying to log in to iteraplan and the user does not exist in iteraplan's user management, iteraplan should create a new user in its user management"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	07/Jan/13 11:46 AM	11/Jun/13 3:03 PM					Security	usability								23/Apr/13 4:46 PM;marek;Tested on Crowd 2.5.3 and 2.6.2	24/Apr/13 6:18 PM;sry;Please your commit your code to SVN, at least your maven module for the 4.x code base	"26/Apr/13 7:14 PM;marek;Code commited for version 3. 
(Rev #20162)"	"26/Apr/13 7:36 PM;sry;Please do also add documentation for administrators to the [Installation Guide|https://www.iteraplan.de/wiki/display/iteraplan/Installation+Guide]

Add documentation for developers to a README file next to the WebContent directory of your customization. It should contains information on a) what it does, b) which uses cases are covered, c) which set up is required (may be a link to admin docu), d) how to test it, e) which libraries are needed for what.

If possible by any means, please remove the {{applicationContext.xml}} file, as it means a lot of synchronization effort. I guess you can simply move the {{<import>}} tag to the Spring Security config file.

I doubt that the use case description for Jack is correct. He should probably be able to log in even if there is no user account in iteraplan for him, as long as Crowd knows him.  (Maybe this is a confusion from an incorrect behaviour in the 4.x implementation...)"	22/May/13 8:19 PM;sry;Any news here?	11/Jun/13 3:03 PM;sry;Looks ok. Testing in customer environment will take place after 3.1 Final release.
