Remove deprecated cssThemes from project	"With the introduction of bootstrap, our previous cssThemes system has become obsolete. My observation is that only two or three files in that directory are actually used to date: {{login.cxx}}, {{iteraplanDefault/images/iteraplan-startscreen-No-Text-800w.png}} and maybe(?) {{custom.css}

These files should be moved to a better location, all references be updated, and the rest off cssThemes be deleted. Please do also move customized files to their equivalent new location, e.g. login.cxx in one customization."
