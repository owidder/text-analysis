PDF export of Landscape Diagram can be blank	PDF export of Landscape Diagram can be blank, if option "scale down to fit A1 size" is NOT checked. SVG works fine.		Bug	iteraplan PO	20/Dec/11 10:59 AM	11/Apr/12 3:04 PM					diagram									20/Dec/11 1:21 PM;sry;From my experience, blank PDFs can be a result of subtle syntax errors in the SVG, which Batik does not like. Maybe this helps during analysis :-)	"11/Apr/12 1:31 PM;kgo;The problem only occurs with the PDF Reader from Adobe (tested with version 10.1.x). According to the PDF version 1.7 specification, page 650 (http://www.adobe.com/devnet/pdf/pdf_reference.html) the maximal page size is limited to 200 inches (approx. 512 cm.). Since the Adobe Reader implements this specification, it does not correctly open documents larger than this.

The built-in readers for Linux and Mac OS don't have this problem. An alternative PDF reader for Windows, which also has no problem with reading larger documents is the Foxit Reader (http://www.foxitsoftware.com/Secure_PDF_Reader/)."	11/Apr/12 3:04 PM;kvo;FAQ ok
