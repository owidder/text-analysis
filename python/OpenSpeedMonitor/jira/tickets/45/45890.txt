E-104 JSON interface does not provide list of business applications, but offers "list.do" file dialog for download, then error			Bug	iteraplan PO	15/Jul/13 3:51 PM	20/Aug/13 5:58 PM														15/Jul/13 6:30 PM;sry;Which error? This problem may only affect browsers which do not know how to handle the application/json MIME type. If so, this is not necessarily a problem for a consuming system.	16/Jul/13 9:58 AM;tdi;@Steffen: The error only comes up when using IE 7/8 to access the JSON interface. With Firefox, there is no error. So the assumption with Mime Type seems to be correct. Is there a way to add new Mime Types to IE 7/8 (for testing purposes)?	16/Jul/13 3:16 PM;sry;It seems that the file can be downloaded and has correct contents.	"20/Aug/13 6:00 PM;sfe;The JSON list does not have to be displayed within the browser for its intended use, which encompasses use as data for iteraplan comboboxes or as input for extern applications.
These use cases work in the current implementation."
