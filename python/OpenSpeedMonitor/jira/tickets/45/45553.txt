Business objects in relation with information systems cannot be deleted when history is enabled	"If you try to delete a business object which is related to one or more information systems via an Isr2BoAssociation, a constraint violation exception from the database appears, if the history is enabled.
Apparently there's an attempt to write an incomplete Isr2BoAssociation object into one of the history tables."		Bug	iteraplan PO	20/Jun/12 11:55 AM	14/Jul/14 6:17 PM					associations	constraint	history	isr2bo						25/Jun/14 4:50 PM;fka;Is this still valid?	"26/Jun/14 9:14 AM;sfe;This should be the same as ITERAPLAN-1916
But the scripts created there were not part of any migration procedure yet, as far as I know, and have been applied on demand so far.
There hasn't been any support case about this issue in quite a while, so I suspect that for the customers affected by this (using iteraplan prior to version 2.9, with enabled history) the issue was fixed in that way."	"14/Jul/14 6:17 PM;fka;Closing for now
Customers affected by this problem will receive individual help from support"
