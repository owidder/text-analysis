Excel Import: Renamed ISR/TCR are not properly linked to existing IS/TC	"Steps for reproduction:
# Create an Excel Export with at least two ISRs, let's call them _foo # 1.0_ and _bar # 2.0_
# Edit the file and rename _foo # 1.0_ to _bar # 1.0_ (assuming that no element with that name exists yet). Leave the ISR ID unchanged.
# Save and import that file again

Effect:
 * The import crashes with a generic internal error message, and the log contains a ConstraintViolationException from the DB.
 * The importer tried to create yet another IS named _bar_, instead of linking the release to the already existing IS.

The same problem probably applies to TCRs as well, and probably also if an element is created anew instead of renaming.
