Use of non-existent CSS class for error messages	"The CSS class ""errorHeader"" is used in many places, but can't be found in the code. The message looks like in attachment ""ErrorMsg missing css class.jpg"".

Keep error messages consistent! Use bootstrap alerts (http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/components.html#alerts) with x-close button!"
