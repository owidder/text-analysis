Use Hierachy in Nesting Cluster Grafic	"Nesting Cluster like demonstrated in attachment (business processes which are part of other processes) should use hierarchical structure: if process is subprocess there should only be one element of it. Also elements in 3rd instance should been showed as sub elements of 2nd instance-processes an so on... 
Use the hierarchical relations of entities would improve expressiveness, multiple presentment of elements will amount to wrong interpretation of data.

Same Feature is interesting for visualization of informations systems and subsystems...
