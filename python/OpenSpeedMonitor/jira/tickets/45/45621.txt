Modify the ant-installer to not build the war in the target directory, use the installers working directory instead	"Currently the ant-installer zips the war file in the user-selected target-directory (defaulted to CATALINA_HOME/webapps). This may lead to erroneous deployment when tomcat polls its webapps dir for autodeploy.

Let the installer create the war in its working dir instead an copy it after successful creation."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	26/Feb/13 5:48 PM	31/May/13 2:49 PM					3.0.5-candidate	installer								31/May/13 2:49 PM;sry;Thx
