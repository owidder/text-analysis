Subscribe dependent on edit-permission	Subscribing an element is dependent on the edit-permission on this element. So, one can't subscribe to an element to which one does not have the edit-permission. This is due to AbstractBuildingBlockService.subscribe() performing a saveOrUpdate() on this element.
