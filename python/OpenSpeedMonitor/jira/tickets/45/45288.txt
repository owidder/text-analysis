Update Libraries	"Update third party libraries used in Spring,
e.g. Spring 3.1, Hibernate?, ..."		Task	iteraplan PO	30/Nov/11 10:55 AM	01/Mar/12 8:56 AM					code	database								"07/Feb/12 1:33 PM;sry;candidates are:
* Spring 3.1
* latest Hibernate 3.6.x + latest matching hibernate search --> update project-internal hibernate patch accordingly
* Commons Lang 3.1
* Commons DBCP 1.3 (1.4 has too strict requirements on JDBC)
* Commons Codec 1.6
* Javassist
* SLF4J (is 1.6 feasible, or only the latest from 1.5 series?)
* JavaMail API by Oracle
* XWiki 2.7, if possible, plus its dependencies
* FreeMarker
* own ideas?

some libs might require fiddling with https://iteraplan.iteratec.de/nexus"	"09/Feb/12 4:31 PM;gph;For update report look at attatched excel sheet.

Didn't update:
* net.sf.ehcache:ehcache-core (2.5.1), because it caused an OutOfMemoryError on tomcat startup
* org.easymock:easymock (3.0), because InformationDiagramFlowTest failed


Is avalon-framework:avalon-framework (4.2.0) still used in the project?"	16/Feb/12 11:06 AM;sip;"Commons Lang 3.1" and "JavaMail API by Oracle" are not updated.	"21/Feb/12 3:31 PM;gph;Commons Lang 3.1 has new group id ""org.apache.commons.lang3"". Too many libraries and classes depend on Commons Lang 2.x.
=> Stay on 2.6."	22/Feb/12 4:37 PM;sry;Spring 3.1.1 [https://jira.springsource.org/browse/SPR/fixforversion/12706 is out], let's update to that one. My first impression is that it fixes one or two bugs that might affect us.	"01/Mar/12 8:55 AM;isc;""JavaMail API by Oracle"" was not updated.
In consultation with Steffen I updated the JavaMail API to version 1.4.4.
"	01/Mar/12 9:17 AM;kvo;Nice. Hibernate 4 is the last big one. Comments on why? why not?	"05/Mar/12 1:01 PM;sry;Hibernate 4 is a major change, and it requires a lot of re-configuration of our Spring set-up, as package names have changed, concepts have been revised, our custom patched classes need to be revisited, etc. Will also require careful testing to be sure that still the same DB schemas are generated or they are at least compatible.

I'd prefer to have this change isolated in a tickets of its own..."
