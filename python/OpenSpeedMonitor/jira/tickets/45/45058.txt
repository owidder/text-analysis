Landscape Diagram with long colour legend not exporting to PDF, bad view in Visio	Landscape Diagram with long colour legend not exporting to PDF, bad view in Visio		Bug	iteraplan PO	20/Jul/11 5:19 PM	02/Aug/11 5:06 PM														"22/Jul/11 5:58 PM;kgo;The bug is caused by the colour or line type legend of a landscape digram having so many entries that it doesn't fit in the DIN A1 page. This leads to negative coordinates, which causes the PDFTranscoder to fail.

The solution to this issue requires the usage of additional pages for the colour and line legends of the landscape diagram (currently only used for the names legend) if these have more than a given number of entries. For this to be achieved, two approaches are possible: either modify the existing names legend logic so that it can accommodate the other legends as well, or consider a new (legend) model which provides a generic approach to the creation and positioning of legends. Both approaches would require significant effort but the latter will at least provide a methodology for conveniently using and configuring legends for all graphical exports and all legend types."	29/Jul/11 3:47 PM;kgo;With the implemented solution the issue is considered to be solved at this point.	02/Aug/11 5:06 PM;vsh;The colour legend overflows out of the bottom of the page for some diagram types in case of more than 40 attribute values, but there is no crash.
