Landscape diagram: Introduce new option to switch the behaviour of the aggregation of relations when reducing the displayed hierarchical levels of the content	"Case:
# Create an IS with two sub-IS. Make sure there are some other IS to use as predecessor links. Make sure there are some business units.
# Link both sub-IS to at least one (arbitrary) predecessor and create at least one business mapping to a business unit for both.
# Configure a landscape diagram for IS, with business units on x-axis and predecessors on y-axis. Make sure that three filters actually find the prepared BBs.
# create a diagram (I used pdf) for all hierarchy levels in all three dimensions. Maybe tweak some filters to make it look clear and un-complex
# reduce the IS dimension to Level 1 and regenerate the diagram

Result:
* Diagram 1 is correct, it shows proper IS-with-predecessor-is-used-by-BU relations
* Diagram 2 shows too many links to business units. See attached LandscapeDiagram-ISLevel1only.png, where Funds transactions #r12 shouldn't have links to Investment + Finance + Capital&Risk in the last two rows. It shouldn't have links to Investment + Finance + Functional Departments in rows 4+5 either.
Currently, in Diagram 2 also other relations are used in generating the diagram. All relations from all Sub-IS are combined with those of the displayed IS.

Introduce an option to switch between the current behaviour and the one described as desired above."
