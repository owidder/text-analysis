Refactor iteraQL-grammar	"The iteraQL-grammar should be extended to support all available operators and value types. Further, we must ensure that the grammar remains extensible.

Further ideas, not necessarily part of this ticket:
* variables in expressions
* arithmetic aggregation operators
* compatibility checks between data types"		Task	iteraplan PO	02/Jul/12 11:33 AM	30/Dec/15 2:32 PM					iteraQL									05/Jul/12 10:14 PM;kvo;Maybe we should also have a list of all control characters and where we need to have validations/escaping to keep them from causing trouble (e.g. property names).
