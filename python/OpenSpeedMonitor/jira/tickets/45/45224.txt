Excel Import: More intelligent attribute name parsing/matching	"Column headers for attribute names are currently parsed rather rigidly. Leading/trailing whitespace, opening/closing braces etc. in attribute names make it impossible to import attribute values.

Attribute name matching should be more flexible, and be able to deal with attribute group names, units in number attributes. Probably this means that several interpretations/decompositions of the table header name should be tested against attributes in iteraplan."
