Partial Excel-Import	"The attributes are at the moment optional, but the building block properties and relations not. 
Make it possible to import only the relevant properties/relations. In this case the irrelevant columns should be deleted.
I think, that the ID and NAME must be always present, since we need them. Also the column separating properties and attributes (containing ""#"" header) should stay untouched. All other columns should be freely configurable."

Deletring the status column also resets and doesn't perserve the value. The same applies for "available for interfaces" for TC.	04/Oct/11 3:15 PM;vsh;Now everything seems OK.
