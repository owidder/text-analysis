The input of a Date for filtering on a date attribute on TabularReports does not handle localized dates	the input field for a date as operand of a filter on a date attribute does always validate the date against the static pattern dd-mm-yyyy instead of using the localized datepattern. furthermore no datepicker is presented here.
