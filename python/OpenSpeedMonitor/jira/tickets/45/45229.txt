Allow object related permissions for roles	"Currently it is only possible to map object related permissions to user/user groups. Therefore it is necessary to maintain user and user groups additionally. This extra work could be reduced/removed by providing object related permissions for roles as well. Role-mechanism already exist in iteraplan and does not require any additional manual user mapping.

*Comment by sry:*
In this case it would be worth considering to remove the concept of user groups from iteraplan completely. Roles provide such a grouping mechanism as well and therefore could be used wherever user groups are used at the moment. 

*Reply from kvo:*
User groups could be usefull for:
* accountability attributes
* as a second iteraplan-specific hierarchie

On the other hand they could be also removed.
