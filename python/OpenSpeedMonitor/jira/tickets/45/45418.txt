Consistency Check "Building Blocks without associations" doesn't work properly	"The consistency check ""Are there any Building Blocks of type [All Building Block Types] which do not have any association to other building blocks?"" does not work properly with ""All Building Block Types"" selected.
The result list contains business mappings, association building blocks like the Tcr2IeAssociation as well as Information Systems and Technical Components (not just releases, which are only displayed when the check correctly doesn't find any associations). All these building block types shouldn't be considered for this check, since the association objects like business mappings or abstract associations only exist when connected to other building blocks anyway, and information systems and technical components shouldn't be directly visible to the user, just their releases."
