Add support for Excel 2007 file format (XLSX) for the legacy Export (Tabular Reports and Successor Report)	"* Update the POI library to v3.9
* Make sure that everything Excel-related uses the format-independent interfaces types, not the specific HSSF implementation types. The Excel2 implementation parts are relatively clean already, the Excel(1) impl probably needs more work. Do not invest any effort into the old XLS import code
* On the Spreadsheet report dialog, add an output format selection for XLSX (Excel 2007) format

The file contents and table structures should be identical, regardless whether it is the binary Excel 2003 or the XML-based 2007 file format.

Most importantly, test import and export carefully, as we don't know yet how well POI supports the new file format. Keep a close eye on (at least) the following aspects:
* performance
* date fields/ cells
* numbers in text cells
* empty cells
* leading or trailing whitespace for text or numbers or dates
* identical visual appearance for exported files, i.e. correct functionality of row hiding, formula computation, cell heights, colouring, worksheet naming and ordering, range name definition, dropdown and validation constraint definition, hyperlinks
* ..."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	04/Mar/13 5:10 PM	18/Apr/13 4:41 PM					excel	format								14/Mar/13 10:59 AM;jme@iteratec.de;POI library is on v3.9 (thanx Steffen).	"14/Mar/13 3:45 PM;jme@iteratec.de;Verwendung der Excelfiles aus dem Ordner ""testFiles"" für die Unittests:

The included macros are a input mask for data. So it is only neccessary for the excel import.
But the legacy import is not extended to the excel 2007 format.

This means, that the macros can be deleted from the excel 2007 template file and the format can be changed to xlsx."	"26/Mar/13 9:35 AM;jme@iteratec.de;There is a excel sheet for the business mappings in the code (along with a unit test).
Hence there is no Report and no Unit Test for the report.

The report could be created as ""simple list"" or ""xml""-file. But it is not visible in the gui.

To clarify: 
- is it correct, that the report cannot be chosen at the gui?
- if the Excelsheet is not neccessary - should I delete it from the code?"	26/Mar/13 9:02 PM;sry;The business mappings sheet is part of IS, BU, BP and Product reports.
