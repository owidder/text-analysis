Support for diagram macros	"For the rich editor (dashboard templates) implements a support for diagram macros.
This should be a pop up where I can choose saved query (diagram).
It should be only this saved query / diagrams displayed, which have the chosen buildingblock type as content.

When the user has selected an saved query / diagram, the id of this saved query surrounded with the <Diagram> tag is to paste into the text area / rich editor.

Example:
 <Diagram>[ID]</Diagram>
