GUI Improvements	"1) Could we apply the same mechanism (Retain expand/collapse state: see ITERAPLAN-271) in section ""Erweiterte Einstellungen"" of ""Masterplangrafik"" when selecting additional columns? Currently, when you select a column and use the add-Button the part of the page collapses and you don't see whether the value was added as additional column.
2) Show selected additional columns in Spreadsheet Reports. Currently after selection the columns are only removed from the drop down list."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	07/Nov/11 9:44 AM	29/Nov/11 8:58 AM					gui									29/Nov/11 8:58 AM;bsi;OK
