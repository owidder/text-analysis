Installer doesn't correctly set build id	Observed for 3.1 RC1 installer. The iteraplan.properties file contained in the application/WEB-INF/classes folder in the installer.jar-file actually contains the correct build.id property value, but for some reason after the installation only the placeholder @build.id@ is there.		Bug	iteraplan PO	27/Jun/13 2:38 PM	02/Jul/13 5:41 PM					installer									27/Jun/13 3:38 PM;sfe;In the installer jar-file, in the directory /various, there is a template for the iteraplan.properties file. This template should contain the build-id already. Possibly the dist-target of the iteraplan build script, creating the installer, doesn't correctly insert the build id.	02/Jul/13 5:41 PM;sry;fine.
