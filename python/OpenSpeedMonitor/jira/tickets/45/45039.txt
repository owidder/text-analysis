Improve maintainability of attribute IDs referenced in saved queries of graphical reports	"Due to the possibility of a change in ids when importing attribute types via the XMI importer, the referenced attribute ids in saved queries have to be updated.
Currently this means that, in case of changes to a graphical report which involve attribute type ids, said changes not only have to be made in the options bean and the XML dto class for the according report, but also in the XMI-importer, more precisely in XmiSavedQueriesHelper.java, which is probably overlooked easily.

Proposal: In the XML dto classes (like ClusterOptionsXML) use a map for handling of all attribute type IDs instead of single variables (but leave the XML schema unchanged). The XMI-importer then can iterate over the entries of said map to update the attribute ids if necessary and doesn't need to be adjusted if attribute type ids are added or removed by future changes."
