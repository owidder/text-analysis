Filtering IS based on their Interface direction gives wrong results	"Filtering IS based on their Interface direction (In Spreadsheet Reports) gives wrong results.
Filtering Interfaces itself is working correctly."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	19/Dec/11 4:56 PM	04/Jan/12 3:58 PM														"21/Dec/11 11:55 AM;kvo;The Filtering itself is working correctly:
 * it filters (independently from IS) all Interfaces with chosen direction

One could argue, that a user wants to filter:
 * dependently from chosen IS
 * the direction has to be taken from the perspective of the filtered IS

This is not how all other filters are working but probably more intuitive."	21/Dec/11 12:01 PM;vsh;Implementation: relatively low, half a day maybe; Maintenance: none	22/Dec/11 12:49 PM;vsh;This should only apply for the direction attribute in case the chosen value is "->" or "<-". For all other interface attributes and for the directions "-" and "<->" the current semantic should be retained.	22/Dec/11 3:12 PM;vsh;What about the interface extension in Technical Components?	28/Dec/11 4:45 PM;vsh;The interface extension in Technical Components doesn't need correction as it returns the expected results.	02/Jan/12 9:54 AM;vsh;There were problems with the unchecked casting in QueryGeneratorTest which was fixed in the last checkin	04/Jan/12 3:58 PM;lci;Works as intended.	23/Jan/12 3:03 PM;bsi;In some of the graphical exports the result set of filtered interfaces is different than for example in spreadsheet reports or landscape graphic.
