Loading a bookmarked iteraplan page leads to problems when trying to fold out the menu	"If you access iteraplan using a bookmark e.g. http://<server>/iteraplan/interface/init.do, you are not able to fold out the complete menu, e.g. for accessing reports. Noting happens after a click.  Maybe some Java Script code is not loaded? After clicking on some of the existing menu entires, the report section then can be folded out (and accessed).The problem occurs with Firefox and IE. However, only IE shows some error message..

IE 8 Error output:

"		Bug	iteraplan PO	30/Sep/11 10:11 AM	14/Oct/11 11:45 AM					usability									"30/Sep/11 10:21 PM;kvo;Works with 2.9RC1 and IE9, Firefox, Chrome and Safari.
Could you verify with IE 8 that problem exists in current version?"	"12/Oct/11 12:54 PM;agu;I could not reproduce this bug also and did not found, under what circumstances it occurs. 
Tobias, if you have additional info, just reopen the ticket. "	"13/Oct/11 8:09 PM;sry;I could now reproduce that behaviour. Probably it happens only if certificate authentication is used. The reason is that IE8 (maybe other browsers as well?) request invalid URIs. Here's a snippet from my httpd's access.log for a request from IE8, for which it got 404 back:
{noformat}
""GET /iteraplan-eon/resources/dojo/;jsessionid=D7D7CCE6C4C35035C81B5056C7EB6857./nls/dojo_en-us.js HTTP/1.1"" 404 952
{noformat}
After reloading/clicking a link, Tomcat has switched to cookie-based session management and the problem goes away automatically.

The reason for that malformed request is probably how our standard.jsp generates the Dojo base URL. Snipped from HTML that IE8 loaded:
{noformat}
var djConfig = {parseOnLoad: true, locale: 'en-us', baseUrl: '/iteraplan-eon/resources/dojo/;jsessionid=8BF9D546BB9371F90563434B162FF560'};
{noformat}
