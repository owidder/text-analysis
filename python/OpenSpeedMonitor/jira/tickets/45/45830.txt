Weird Error Page	"sometimes error pages are displayed somehow weird. see screenshot.
breadcrumbs do not reflect the correct hierarchy and context-actions are broken.

to reproduce the screenshot:
# take a fast export link
# change the resultFormat parameter of the url to ""jpg"" (which is wrong)
# open the url

the error page behaves somehow differently depending on what page was successfully rendered to the same user before the error"		Bug	iteraplan PO	03/Jul/13 6:06 PM	04/Jul/13 11:44 AM														"04/Jul/13 11:44 AM;sry;Weird, but unproblematic.
