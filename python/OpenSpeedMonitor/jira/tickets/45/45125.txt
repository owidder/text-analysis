Invalid Business Mapping DB entries after deleting a business mapping from BP, BU or Product	"If you edit a business process and remove any of its business mappings, then that old business mapping will get corrupted and stay in the database. The BP reference is set to NULL, the rest of the values are retained.
As a consequence, the IS, BU etc. from that corrupted business mapping will behave strangely and some operations will cause NullPointerExceptions."

All good.
