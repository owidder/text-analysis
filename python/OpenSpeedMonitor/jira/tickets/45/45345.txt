Nesting Cluster Diagram doesn't properly restore all of the saved settings when loading a saved report	"The setting for route/relationship (outer2inner) and the outer element recursive setting (outer2outer) are set to the default/start value after loading a saved report, even if they were saved differently.
The settings are written into the saved report xml under the viewpointConfig element as entries with the keys ""outer.outer2inner"" and ""outer.outer2outer"", but don't seem to be read and/or set from there properly.

These two settings also don't persist when you switch to another page of iteraplan and back, or refresh the page.
In this case, outer and inner element selection also is reverted to the state of the last saving or loading or executing of a nesting cluster diagram."		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/Jan/12 4:16 PM	02/Apr/12 9:46 AM					diagram	VBB	visualization
