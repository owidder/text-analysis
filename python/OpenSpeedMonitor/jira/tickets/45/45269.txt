excel import fails if there are too many brackets in the attribute name	"When trying to import applications, the Excel import would not allow the attribute:
{tmp} YYY (XXX) (ZZZ (temporary))

Further investigation showed the problem to be with the ""("" and "")"" characters. I changed the attribute name to:
{tmp} YYY [XXX] (ZZZ (temporary))

And the import functioned correctly. The import should not fail even if brackets are used for attribute names!"
