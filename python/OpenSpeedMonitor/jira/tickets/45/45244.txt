Name as optional identificator for object related permission import	Object related permissions are imported according to the building block id. Managing the Excel file for large data sets (like E.ON's) can be rather tedious, because the ids aren't especially meaningful. We can provide an optional name column to try to load the building block by its name. In case no name is provided or the name has changed, the id will be used.
