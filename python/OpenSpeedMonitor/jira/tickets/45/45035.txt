Error-page when selecting an invalid ExcelWorkbook as template for excel export	"When trying to export the results of a tabular report into an excel sheet, and the selected template is invalid (for example there already exist sheets with the same names as the sheets the export will try to create), the general error page of iteraplan is shown.
A more meaningful error message, stating the template was invalid, would be nice."		Bug	iteraplan PO	12/Jul/11 10:28 AM	28/Oct/11 12:07 PM					excel	reports	tabular							27/Oct/11 2:49 PM;agu;The error messages were improved.
