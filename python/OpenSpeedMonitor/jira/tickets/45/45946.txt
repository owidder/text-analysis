Check and document semantics of context visualizations for consistency	"Check what is to be displayed in constext visualizations.

for example if i create a landscape diagram from within an IS that is in state 'plan' the IS is not displayed in the visualization.
perhaps in this case the landscape diagram should additionally (or only?) contain planned BBs.

Furthermore please add a documentation clarifying the exact semantics of the context visualizations."		Task	iteraplan PO	02/Aug/13 4:28 PM	30/Dec/15 3:17 PM														"02/Aug/13 4:40 PM;wfr;Ideas to discuss with DM and users, alternatives:

For a regular ISR, that is current and active (today), only such ISRs should be displayed as context.

For any ISR, regardless of its state and activity, it shold be displayed in its context diagram.

For an inactive ISR, also inactive ISRs should be displayed as context.

Even for an not active (today) ISR, only active ISRs should be displayed.

For a planned but not current ISR, only planned, but not current, ISRs should be displayed.

For a planned but not current ISR, both planned an current ISRs should be displayed.

Same for target.

Same for inactive (state).

Combination of active (state) and active by runtime period?
