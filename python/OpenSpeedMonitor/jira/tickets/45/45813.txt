Excel document templates cannot be used for spreadsheet reports if the number of customizations in the ApplicationResourcesCustom.properties-File exceeds 54	When trying to use document templates for spreadsheet reports iteraplan fails if there are more than 54 entries  in ApplicationResourcesCustomXYZ.properties (blank lines and comments are ignored). Putting entries in several files yields the same result as well as switching to another language (without customizations)		Bug	iteraplan PO	01/Jul/13 2:51 PM	02/Jul/13 1:13 PM					excel	reports								01/Jul/13 3:01 PM;dne;sample cusomization files	01/Jul/13 3:29 PM;sry;How does it fail?

edit: sorry ... there is something in the log file - see attached"	"02/Jul/13 12:36 PM;sry;The log says: {{The workbook already contains a sheet of this name}}
I suppose this is because of the two types {{<<nicht verwendeter Bebauungselementtyp_1>> and _2}} Because of a length constraint, worksheet names are trimmed to a certain length, and these two names are probably identical after trimming to length.

If you put the number to the front, it'll probably work."	02/Jul/13 1:00 PM;dne;... I really thought it was running with a short file although I had that name conflict ... Must have kicked out the wrong strings. Anyway it's working fine now :) Thanks
