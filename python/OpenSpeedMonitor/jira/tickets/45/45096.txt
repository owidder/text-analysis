Performance of the SVG Graphics Generation	When using large data sets (several hundred to several thousand entities per graphic) a signifficant performance loss can be observed with some of the SVG graphics as compared to their Visio conterparts. In particular, the Landscape and Masterplan Diagrams require much longer to generate the SVG output than the Visio logic does.
