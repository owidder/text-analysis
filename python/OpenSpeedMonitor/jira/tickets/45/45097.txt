Make content spanning of the Landscape Diagram optional	Currently, content elements of the Landscape Diagram span between neighbouring cells if the represented entity is associated with both pairs of axis elements. This should be made optional. When disabled, the content elements should be placed independently in each cell, so that the readability of the diagram can be improved.
