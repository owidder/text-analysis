Coloring for Business Mappings in LSD	"If several Business Mappings fullfill the mapping of a cell (i.e. have the value of both axes and the content cell) and a coloring by an attribute of a Business Mapping is active,



* use Multi-value-coloring for every attribute value of all Business Mappings fullfilling the condition of the cell

* Show also undefined-values

* color the cell with many colored stripes in a predefined order (do not aggregate the colored stripes or re-order them)

* The order is by ID of the Business Mapping ascending



* There is a limit for colors of multi-value coloring. Please ensure that this limit is set to 20.

* Ensure this solution also works for coloring for attributes on Business Mappings, even if one axis does not belong to a Business Mapping

* Take care, that it is possible that one Business Object appears multiple times in one diagram"		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	19/Oct/16 12:46 PM	20/Oct/16 3:06 PM														"20/Oct/16 1:26 PM;pma;Review comments:
