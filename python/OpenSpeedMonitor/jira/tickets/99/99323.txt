Update migration guide	"Necessary information:

* First migration script, then migration tool (the latter is only necessary if there exists history data)

* Necessary files to run migration tool (to be provided by the customer by copying them next to the migration tool jar file)

** iteraplan-db.properties

** iteraplan.properties

** iteraplan_local.properties

** JDBC connector jar

* How to run the tool (should be basically just ""extract and execute the right run script"")"	96257	Sub-task	iteraplan Thunderduck	17/Oct/16 11:01 AM	20/Oct/16 10:36 AM														17/Oct/16 3:30 PM;sfe;Updated here: https://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan54/Upgrade+Guide	"18/Oct/16 2:24 PM;mse;I have made some small changes to the wiki page during review.
