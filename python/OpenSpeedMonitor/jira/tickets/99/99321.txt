Check thread section in user docu regarding Tomcat settings	"The section ""Limit Maximum Number of Request-processing Threads"" in 

https://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan54/Tomcat+Configuration

might be outdated. The Tomcat on the demo server e.g. says that it ignores this setting.



Review this section and adjust (or even delete) it. Maybe we need to distinguish between Tomcat versions. Keep in mind, that we only support Tomcat 7 and 8, no older versions."
