Interface History shows unnecessary "empty" entries	"_Reproduce:_

# Activate history if not already

# Create a new Interface between two Information Systems

# Query the history of the Interface via REST



_Expected:_ INSERT change for the Interface showing the connection to the two selected Information Systems, also setting of Direction

_Actual:_ As above, but in addition changes for name and description, although nothing was set there. The changes also don't show added or removed values.



Those ""non"" changes should not be written to the database."		Bug	iteraplan PO	20/Oct/16 2:23 PM	21/Oct/16 8:14 AM
