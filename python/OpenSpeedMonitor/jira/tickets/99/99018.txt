Expected:

That only the first three checkboxes are active"		Bug	iteraplan PO	13/Oct/16 1:16 PM	26/Oct/16 1:24 PM														"24/Oct/16 10:46 AM;roia;Current implementation does not match the initial reqirements (see IPTS-139):

{quote}As soon as the user changes the filter clauses in some way, the manual selection list is reset to default (all elements).{quote}



The manual selection *should be reset* when user makes some changes on the ""Filter"" tab and *should not be changed* when there're no changes. Current update just disabled manual selection completely -- no matter if there were changes or not.



So as the filter implementation works well for the other diagrams and does not work well for LSD I'd look what's wrong in LSD first, not change the global implementation.

The second place to look -- {{filterDialogController.js}} file, methods where {{this.setBusinessObjects(true);}} is called from. Passing true resets the manual selection."
