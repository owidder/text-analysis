Change content of "relation" field in JSON for changes in association elements	"Currently, if there are changes to the relation between IS and IE, a json fragment might look like this:



{noformat}

        {

          ""relation"": ""isr2Ie"",

          ""changesOfRelations"": [

            {

              ""idOfRelatedBB"": 350,

              ""changetype"": ""INSERT"",

              ""changes"": [ ... ]

...

{noformat}



Change the content of the field ""relation"" to the actual path to the related type.

In this case to ""/infrastructureElementAssociations/infrastructureElement"".

For this, adjust the constants used in {{HistoryEntriesBuilderVisitor}} and create new ones where necessary, to set the field differently dependent of the main type it is viewed from."
