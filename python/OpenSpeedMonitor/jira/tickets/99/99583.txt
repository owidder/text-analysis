Add names of connected elements to tables of association history	"Association types, for example Isr2BoAssociation, have columns for the IDs of the building blocks they connect in their history table.

Additionally add columns for the names of the connected elements and adjust the history entities and HistoryEntryBuilder accordingly.



Also, when creating the Json for the history, use the names of those connected elements instead of the ids.



This also applies to Business Mappings (whose history table gets four more columns this way)."		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	18/Oct/16 3:02 PM	19/Oct/16 4:08 PM														19/Oct/16 2:08 PM;mse;Commit 26339 does not belong here, sorry!
