Interface history: Information Systems don't see changes	"_Reproduce:_

# Activate history if not already activated

# Create a new Interface between two Information Systems A and B

# Open history of Information System A (or B)



_Expected:_ Entry to show an added Interface

_Actual:_ Nothing



This behavior extends to changes of the Interface, when one or both of the Information Systems in an Interface are changed.

Both the Information System that ""loses"" the Interface, and the newly assigned Information System don't show the change.

Also, if an Interface is deleted, the connected Information Systems don't show any change.



When an interface is created, the information system should show a ""normal"" relationship add of the interface. We don't distinguish between the two interface relationshipEnds here."
