Wrong timestamp in History	"- Make change on some building block (e.g status of IS from PLANNED to TARGET) in classic client

- Look at the corresponding history entry in single element view: the timestamp is 2 hours later



NOTE: the corresponding REST-JSON returns proper timestamps (sse pic)

I have pushed potential fix in the revision 4768 - replaced the JS date parsing with moment.js parsing, but I'm not sure if it helps or not.

If it does not help then someone who can reproduce it should work on this issue. Functions to look at: {{translateDateOrTime()}} and {{translateDateTime()}} in {{utils.js}}"	21/Oct/16 11:16 AM;msr;I can confirm that it is fixed now on my local machine. @reviewer: Please double-check.	24/Oct/16 3:19 PM;mash;Review is done: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-109
