Execute Testsheet



*Details:*

* Ensure you have all the actual branch code

* Perform all steps carefully

* If the system is different than the testcases, check, if it is a bug or if the testsheet needs to be corrected.

** If it is a bug, create immediately a bugticket in the epic ""Release 5.4""

** If it is not a bug, correct the testsheet. "		Task	iteraplan PO	14/Oct/16 1:31 PM	26/Oct/16 11:04 AM														"20/Oct/16 3:17 PM;ddu;ERRORS DETECTED. As the tests were made with Internet Explorer, multiple errors appeared.



Especially:

TC2 step5: Selecting nodes on Information Flow Diagram does not work properly

TC2 step 12: The control used to select numeric value ""between"" does not show itself correctly

TC4 step 10: Manual Selection does not keep the previously selected values"	"21/Oct/16 9:48 AM;mse;I cannot reproduce the problems reported by Daniel. I used IE11 and everything works ok (although slow...).



Please re-execute TC2 - TC5 with IE (also IE10 if possible) and update the report."	21/Oct/16 11:11 AM;ddu;I repeated the tests quickly and found that in the current nightly almost all the errors are not present, BUT the Error reported in TC2 Step 4 is still present. Manuel already saw it also on his computer and is going to create a development/fix ticket for it. The tests should be repeated first after the fix is in place.	21/Oct/16 11:13 AM;ddu;Needs to repeat the selected tests after fix is in place	26/Oct/16 8:54 AM;ddu;Tests has been executed again, using Internet Explorer 11 - exept of the already known error with selection of element on the diagram, additional error came. The "manual selection" in the filter dialog is not persistent and is removed as soon as the filter dialog is re-opened.
