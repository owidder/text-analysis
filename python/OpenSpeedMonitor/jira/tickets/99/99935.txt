After setting "History enabled" - changing into Deutsch and Press F5 the checkbox is disabled	"Reproduce (with sample data):



# Open ""Administration"" and ""System"" 

# Activate the checkbox ""History enabled""

# Change the language into ""Deutsch""

# Press F5

# The language is changed into ""English"" and the checkbox ""History enabled"" is empty



Expected: The language Deutsch stays and the ""checkbox"" is checked in 

Actual: The language changes to English and the ""checkbox"" is empty 



Note: This happens not every time, but every time when Tomcat is restarted. "		Bug	iteraplan PO	20/Oct/16 11:50 AM	21/Oct/16 1:00 PM														"21/Oct/16 12:00 PM;roia;According to this note

I have also checked the following scenario:



*Pre-conditions:* history is disabled, language is set to English, some page of a classic client is open on the ""other"" tab.

1. Open Administration -> System

2. Activate the checkbox ""History enabled""

3. Change the language into ""Deutsch""

4. Restart the tomcat. While restarting I'm getting the ""sessions loading"" exception. Is it okay?

5. I have to re-login, so I refresh the ""other"" tab where the classic client page is open and re-login.

6. Refresh the Administration -> System



With these steps the issue is not reprobucible - after refresh I get the checkbox checked and German language. No errors in console.



Investigated in Firefox v. 49.0.2 on windows."	"21/Oct/16 12:23 PM;roia;If somebody can reproduce the issue, after pressing F5 check the following:

* errors in the console

* response of {{/api/historystate}} request. Should be:

{code}

{""enabled"":true}

{code}

* response of {{/api/user/settings}}. Should be something like:

{code}

{""settings"":[{""featureName"":""/locale"",""setting"":""de""}]}
