RELEASE: For association type history entries, do not create redundant change entries	"Currently, when a new attributable association is created, at least two history entries are written to the database.

For example, if a Isr2IeAssociation is created between IS ""Broker"" and IE ""Server 2"", two history entries of type ""INSERT"" are created:

# ""Broker"" added for feature ""informationSystemRelease""

# ""Server 2"" added for feature ""infrastructureElement""



After changes in IPTT-194, this information is redundant, as the building blocks connected by the association are already known via their own columns/fields.

Instead only write a single INSERT entry with empty feature, added and removed fields, if no other feature was set initially. Else write only changes for that other feature.

The same holds true for the equivalent DELETE case.



Adjust Json generation accordingly (if empty changes are not supported yet).

Adjust database schema if necessary due to not null constraints."		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	18/Oct/16 3:29 PM	20/Oct/16 10:01 AM
