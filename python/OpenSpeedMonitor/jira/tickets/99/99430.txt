History table columns "added_value" and "removed_value" are too small	"Since changes of relationship assignments are saved as a json array of the names of all added or removed elements, the current column type of varchar(255) is to small to hold some of those changes.



Model the added and removed values as java set in the history change entity.

Split the resulting tables for added and removed values according to building block type.

Adjust migration scripts accordingly."		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	17/Oct/16 5:51 PM	19/Oct/16 9:03 AM
