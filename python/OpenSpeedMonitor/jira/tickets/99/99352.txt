Nested Cluster -  Problems with coloring and filter	"After following setup, the diagram / legend dont work correctly. Filtering and coloring are mixed together and ends in a white page. 



# Open the Nested Cluster Diagram

# Cluster by ""Building Block"" and ""Product

# Coloring by Accountability

# Change to ""Attribute"" and ""Costs"" 

# Open the Legend - the color settings dont show the correct value 



The same problem can be reproduce, when a Filter is set.

By changing from ""Building Block"" to ""Attribute"" the color and filters reseting"		Bug	iteraplan PO	17/Oct/16 1:16 PM	21/Oct/16 5:22 PM														21/Oct/16 11:33 AM;dmkh;[~cst], in current implementation we cannot color by Accountability for Product as "Cluster by" type (step 3 of STR), but the issue was reproduced also for other attributes.	21/Oct/16 1:38 PM;dmkh;Also in scope of this ticket removed Display->Highlighting entries in toolarea for attribute clusters (clarified with [~msr]).	21/Oct/16 5:21 PM;mash;Review is done: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-102#details
