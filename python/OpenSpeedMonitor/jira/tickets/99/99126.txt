Execute Testsheet



*Details:*

* Ensure you have all the actual branch code

* Perform all steps carefully

* If the system is different than the testcases, check, if it is a bug or if the testsheet needs to be corrected.

** If it is a bug, create immediately a bugticket in the epic ""Release 5.4""

** If it is not a bug, correct the testsheet.

"20/Oct/16 3:02 PM;mse;I re-tested the last steps of TC4 where Daniel suspected some problems with his configuration and got failing tests.



In my configuartion the saved query needed for the test was there and the test succeeded."
