!error.jpg|thumbnail!"	"19/Oct/16 3:38 PM;cst;Dear Mrs. and Mr,

thank you for your inquiry.

Appears the diagram, when you wait a little bit?
For Google Chrome the maximal displayed elements are 500. 

At the moment this is the default limit for the shown elements. 

This limit cant be changed.
In the future it is possible to change this limit, but in iteraplan 5.3 this feature is not implement.

Would you please check following Troubleshooting article to improve the performance in interactive client:

Does it mean that we need to check the setting from client side?
Will this be improved during the next release?

Thanks and Regards,
Daby"	"02/Nov/16 10:20 AM;cst;Hi Daby,

thank you for your reply. 

This settings are for the clients wich are using iteraplan. 

Last week, we released the version 5.4 of iteraplan and did many improvements on the interactive client.
You could update your version 5.3 to 5.4 and check for a better performance.

Greetings,
