Implementation: Output format PDF	"*Summary:*

Implement the solution of ITERAPLAN-3889.

1. Create a diagram as SVG (exists already)

2. Send the SVG via REST (extend REST interface)

3. Transform the SVG on the server via Batic (maybe new Batik version needed?)

4. Send the pdf asynchronously (as promise) to the client"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	02/Sep/15 3:42 PM	09/Nov/15 11:45 AM					download	ifd	pdf
