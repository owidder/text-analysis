Partial IFD	"*Summary:*

Create a partial Information Flow Diagram for many elements in the diagram.



*Affected parts:*

* ifdDataService (for filtering)

* ifdTemplate or ifdDiagramBuilder (to show warning)



*Approach:*

Filter as early as possible, i.e. in the ifdDataService to improve performance. In the ifdDATAService:

* Get all Information Systems (fullfilling the filter criteria of the user).

* AFTER you have these ""relevantInformationSystems"" sort them alphabetically ascending

* Use the first x Information Systems for the diagram (there is no limit for the Information Flows)

* One exception: If the user has pinned some Information Systems (saved in the ifdConfiguration) (see ITERAPLAN-3867 ), these pinned are always shown in any partial diagram.



The download is disabled for a partial diagram. (check again with [~wfr] if download should be disabled or not).

Analyse and implement the best limit for elements shown (feedback to this limit by [~sfe] or [~wfr] ).



*UI:*

Use same UI as Nested Cluster Diagram, i.e. show a red text saying this is only a partial diagram.



*Acceptance criteria:*

* Starting point: An Information Flow Diagram is open with some active filters and pinned elements. It is not a partial diagram, i.e. not too many Information Systems on the screen.

* The user deletes a filter and now too many Information Systems would be shown

* A warning (like in the NCD) appears on the top left corner of the diagram

* The updated diagram still contains all pinned elements as well as the ""alphabetically first"" Information Systems (starting with ""a"")

* The download is disabled (=greyed out)

* The user sets another filter with the resulting Information Systems are lower than the limit

* The warning for partial diagram disappears and all elements are shown again.

* The download works again."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	02/Sep/15 11:31 AM	21/Sep/15 11:39 AM					ifd	partial								"18/Sep/15 11:13 AM;isc;In agreement with WFR:

* Download is no need to disable

* In the downloaded diagram,  the information must be clearly recognizable, that the diagram is partial



In agreement with SFR:

* the pin function is currently not implemented 

* pinned elements are not yet considered in this ticket
