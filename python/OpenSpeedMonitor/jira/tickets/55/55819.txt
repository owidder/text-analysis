INCLUDE FEATURE: Colouring by numeric attribute	"*Summary:*

Create the option for the Information Flow Diagram to colour by numeric attributes.



*Affected parts of the system:*

* ifdConfiguration (save configuration)

* ifdController

* ifdContentController

* ifdContentMain

* ifdItemDecorator (color boxes)

* ToolArea (UI to set, update or delete color)

* ifdLegendMain

* ifdLegendBuilder (show actual coloring)



*Approach:*

* Use ITERAPLAN-3858 as a blueprint.

* Use GoJS

* Use the ifdConfiguration as well as the url to save actual coloring

* Decide, if you want to create an extra class for ifdLegendColoring (to ensure the ifdLegendBuilder gets not too big)

* Colorpicker is not in scope of this ticket but in scope of ITERAPLAN-3868



*UI:*

Use ToolArea to select, update or delete coloring. Show actual coloring in the legend."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	02/Sep/15 11:33 AM	10/Jun/16 1:53 PM					color	ifd								"26/Apr/16 3:14 PM;msr;First review comments:
