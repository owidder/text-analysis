TBD: Switch between Interfaces and InformationFlows	"*Summary:*

Implement a switch between Interfaces and InformationFlows as line type.



*Affected parts of the system:*

* ifdToolAreaViewModelBuilder (create a new toolarea item for the switch)

* toolAreaTemplate / css (a new switch button)

* ifdController (communication to toolArea)

* ifdConfiguration (save configuration and set to url)

* ifdDataService (fetch informationflows or interfaces)

* ifdLegendBuilder (show setting in legend)



*UI:*

Set and change this setting in the Toolarea according to https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=52134452#InformationFlowDiagram%28IFD%29-Toolarea

Default is InformationFlows.



*Acceptance criteria:*

* The user select a box (or a line)

* The Toolarea is opened

* Click on Information Flows.

* A submenu opens.

* Select Interfaces.

* The Toolarea disappears immediately, the diagram is redrawn with this new configuration, the url and the legend is updated."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	02/Sep/15 2:08 PM						ifd
