Structure 2: Methods and API	"Add methods for

* adding a filter

* deleting a filter

Clearify which methods have to be provided for the UI and implement them



Still open:

* addLevelFilter - This should be easy. Maybe, we should bypass the ""buildFilterObject""-method here and directly create a new SingleLevelFilter.

* some tests

* Correct ""relationshipEnds"" of primaryType. Simply calling primaryType.relationshipEnds does not yield the RelationshipEnds that are connected by an attributed edge. Method ""getRelations"" in dataModel might be the right one.

*  Right handling of those new ""RelationshipEnds"". This includes tracking used/unused and creation of predicates. Note that only the CombinedFilter-predicate has to take care of this. All other predicates apply to RelationshipEnd.type

* The metamodel knows the relationship ends (direct or composite) for a given (node) type.

* BUT the more complex rules for composing multistep relationship ends for the nesting cluster diagram are part of the NCD code.



For the different kind of relationship ends, see ITERAPLAN-4278"	08/Jan/16 3:38 PM;msr;MBr: "Still open" is already closed in the meantime.	"11/Jan/16 6:40 AM;msr;Review comments:

* The ""addFilter"" or deleteFilter-methods were not commmitted to this ticket, but to ITERAPLAN-4244. In this ticket only ""addSingleLevelFilter"" was added. 

* ""addSingleLevelFilter"" is ok.

* Line coverage is only 89% (missing e.g. addLevelFilterOnPrimaryType, addNoConnectionFilter , removeLevelFilterFromPrimaryType, buildFilterObject, ...)"	15/Jan/16 4:36 PM;msr;Line coverage was enhanced
