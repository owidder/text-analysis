Filter to URI and vice versa	"Add methods to create URI-components out of filters.

Add methods to create a filters out of URI-components."	65407	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	09/Dec/15 6:51 PM	02/Feb/16 2:48 PM														"04/Jan/16 2:33 PM;ach;* please ignore first and second commits - uri structure was changed with third commit.

* singleFilter constructors probably don't need so much arguments(translate service, owner Type, owner Key) 

** semantically translate service doesn't belong to filter implementation at all

** owner Type/Key should be handled by corresponding RelationshipEndFilter

 -> may be refactored later



* unit test.

** may be we have to test more detailed later

** creates a combined filter with complex primary filter, levelfilter and 3 relendFilters.(connected+filtered, connected+without filtering, without connection)

** converts this filter to uri and back, compares input and output."	"04/Jan/16 2:56 PM;ach;Uri Structure:

Add references to that file in all JSDoc comments of methods that convert to and from URI part



References can be simple text, no JSDoc tool experiments for now."	"29/Jan/16 6:51 PM;ach;after review by [~wfr] - improvements done,

please review last two comments (someone else, not [~wfr]) and confirm, whether txt-comment is understanable."	02/Feb/16 2:48 PM;lwi;checked only last 3 commits (as mentioned in the comments)
