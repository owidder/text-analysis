Move decision "technical or regular" to JS metamodel	"Move the decision if a property is sutiable for regular display and/or filtering to the metamodel.



As is: the filter dialog (... model builder) excludes properties as for example ID or position from the menu.



To be: the filter dialog asks the metamodel (or its parts). It must not use name comparison in any way.



In the scope of this tiicket is both the addition to the metamodel and the required modification of all components using the metamodel.



todo in metamodel

- type has list of regular properties (without ID, positions, ...) , in parallel to list of all properties

- class property has field ""isRegular"" (working name)

- hard coded ""black list"" of names of technical/irregular properties in JS class Property
