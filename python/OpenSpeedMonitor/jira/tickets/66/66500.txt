Separate relationPath into relationshipEnd and property	"*Summary:*

Separate relationPath into relationshipEnd and property



*Actual:*

The relationshipEnd and the property are concated into 1 string separated by a ""/"".



*To-Be:*

Separate in 2 different strings in the whole code.

By reading from the url in the lsdConfiguration separate the url-string directly in the 2 strings.

The relationshipEnd part may still contain several relationshipEnd persistent names joined by ""/"", but the property has to be separate.



*Affected js-files:*

* FilterDialogBuilder: Put the relationPath out of the persistentName and in a new field. Transfer this new field to the lsdConfiguration

* lsdConfiguration: Adapt the ""setFilter""-function with new field *AND* adapt the ""Read & apply parameters from query"" to parse the url

* combinedFilter: Adapt ""addFilter""

* SingleFilterObject: Constructor with new parameter for path"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	12/Dec/15 12:24 PM	21/Dec/15 1:04 PM														16/Dec/15 7:51 PM;msr;@reviewer: I'm available for questions from 21st Dec on.	"21/Dec/15 8:17 AM;dam;code looks good.
