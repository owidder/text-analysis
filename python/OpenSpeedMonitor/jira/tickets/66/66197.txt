Filter to predicate	"Add methods to create predicate.

* Each filter in the CombinedFilters hierarchy has a ""toPredicate"" method which returns a function that can be applied to a given type. Superior filters (OrFilter, AndFilter,...) aggregate those predicates.

* Subqueries given by RelationshipEndFilters need to be cached. Suggestion: RelationshipEndFilters keep resultLists. After resultList has been created once the predicate will only be something like ""is contained in resultList"".

* RelationshipEndFilters can be ""no connection""-filters. The predicate must be accordant."	65407	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	09/Dec/15 6:50 PM	02/Feb/16 11:41 AM														15/Jan/16 5:04 PM;msr;Please commit to FilterBranch	"18/Jan/16 5:07 PM;ach;- replaced asPredicate function by matches function, that returns boolean value (not the whole predicate function)

- subqueries for relEndFilter are lazy evaluated and cached 

- singleFilters used to use wrong named methods getPropertyValue (the right one is getPropertyValue*s*)"	28/Jan/16 9:20 AM;sfe;Originally 2PD	"01/Feb/16 11:39 AM;mbr;The SingleFilterHolder's singleFilter object is initially empty. This needs to be considered in the orFilter's matches-method.

Suggestion: Implement matches method in SingleFilterHolder "
