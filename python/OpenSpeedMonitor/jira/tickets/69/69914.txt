Graphics Reactor: file list doesn't update	"Reported by a customer and recreated in our test SSO installation:

# Open Graphics Reactor in IE (tested with version 11, may happen in other versions or browsers, too)

# Upload a file to or delete a file from Graphics Reactor



_Expected:_ File list updates accordingly

_Actual:_ File is created/deleted on server, but reactor file list doesn't update"		Bug	iteraplan PO	18/Jan/16 10:31 AM	28/Jan/16 1:31 PM					reactor									28/Jan/16 1:31 PM;lwi;a nice one liner :)
