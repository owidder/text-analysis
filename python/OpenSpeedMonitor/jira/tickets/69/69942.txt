Read properties files in one place only	"Currently, we read iteraplan's properties files at two locations:

* applicationContext.xml

* class IteraplanProperties



Change this so the class IteraplanProperties also uses spring mechanisms to read the properties files to avoid inconsistencies."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	18/Jan/16 2:55 PM	21/Jan/16 1:57 PM
