Properties files are read in the wrong order in IteraplanProperties	"There are two locations where properties files are read in iteraplan.

# the file {{applicationContext.xml}}

# the class {{IteraplanProperties}}



In {{IteraplanProperties}}, however, the order is wrong. The file iteraplan_local.properties is read too early, so that iteraplan-db.properties and iteraplan-auth.properties can overwrite settings there.

Usually this shouldn't have an affect on how iteraplan runs, since the settings from -db and -auth properties are used in the xml file.

But the iteraplan system info reads its info from IteraplanProperties, thus can display wrong values."		Bug	iteraplan PO	15/Jan/16 8:59 AM	19/Jan/16 11:16 AM														19/Jan/16 11:16 AM;msr;Looks good
