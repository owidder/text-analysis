StackOverflowError in elastic model clone	"The clone method of the elastic ModelImpl can cause a stack overflow error for large models of a certain structure.

This is when the model clone traverses the model graph along a very long path so the available stack size is exceeded.



To fix this, change the model clone implementation to not use a recursive depth-first approach."
