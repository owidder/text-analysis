Plain Elastic Adapter (read)	"plugins can only act with simple methods (parameters and return values as primitive types):

therefore:

extend elastic model (or better: create an elastic model adapter) with functionality for *reading* model values with no elastic types as  parameters (or return values)



from https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/display/ITPL/Notes+on+Reactions (only read-relevant parts):

FlatModel

* all objects of a type

* object by Id (and type)

* object by name (and type)



Caution: ""all objects"" may be expensive for large models, for example all IS of E-104.



FlatObject

* get a Property value, by Property name

* explicitly 2 methods getSinglePropertyValue and getMultiplePropertyValue

* if multiplicity does not fit the definition: error, no implicit type coercion.

* return types String, Number, Date for obvious cases

* return literal persistent name as String for enumeration

* Duration: OPEN array of 2 items, or JS object from/to - decided to use an array of two dates

* multiple elements as JS array

* get relatedObjects by relationship endpoint expression persistent name

* returns FlatObject or array of...

* explicit variants for ...Single... and ...Multiple... as above for properties



Decision: assigned values of multi value properties and related elements of multi value relationships have no defined order."	89431	Sub-task	iteraplan Thunderduck	06/Jul/16 11:01 AM	11/Jul/16 2:27 PM														"07/Jul/16 11:25 AM;sfe;Changeset [25530|https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/changelog/iteraplan?cs=25530] was accidentally committed with a wrong comment and belongs in this ticket.

Changes: Added ""findByTypeAndName"" to FlatModel and added a test."
