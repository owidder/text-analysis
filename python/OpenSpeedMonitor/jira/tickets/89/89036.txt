Do we need highlighting of outer elements? As I see they are not repeating and there is no need to highlight a single element in whole diagram. Maybe you meant highlighting of nested elements? (see the attachment, where nested elements are highlighted) 



[~msr], please, specify this requirement."	"06/Jul/16 2:58 PM;msr;Yes, I mean both.

Please highlight all inner including the nested elements.

Also, please highlight the outer inlcuding the outer nested elements even if they can occur only one time."	"18/Jul/16 2:12 PM;roia;Reviewed: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-68

[~dmkh], please see my questions"
