Create sceleton implementation of the Portfolio diagram	"Create a sceleton implementation of the whole diagram,

i.e. create all rudimentary *files* (without any functionality) and *all connections* to each other.



No unit tests



Take the already implemented ""MPD""-Diagram as blueprint and use same architecture.



Differences to MPD:

* Analyse, if you use the same ""model"" throughout the pipeline

* Prefix ""pfd"" instead of ""mpd"" (and route)

* tableModelBuilder is now pfdDiagramModelBuilder

* graphBuilder is now pfdGojsModelBuilder

* No title

* Static toolbar



You are free to improve the architecture after consulting [~msr]"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	05/Jul/16 8:50 PM	13/Jul/16 4:11 PM														"12/Jul/16 12:05 PM;mada;Please check open review comments:
