GoJS scrollbars got broken after GoJS library update	"To display scrollbars GoJS library has been using two <div>s in the diagram container after the <canvas> element -- one div for horizontal scrolling and one for vertical.

The updated version uses one div instead of two, so display of scroll bars and resizing got broken."		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	05/Jul/16 2:45 PM	08/Jul/16 4:37 PM														"08/Jul/16 4:36 PM;dmkh;Great, code review is complete without any comments, bug is fixed.
