Analyse and fix the translation service	"Bug:

If we use the angular filemanager of [IPTQ-3] the iteraplan translations will not bw available through the translation service. There is something wrong with the loading of the iteraplan translations.



What should happen?

Both translations of iteraplan and the angular filemanager should be available."		Bug	iteraplan Quickfox	07/Jul/16 6:26 PM	13/Jul/16 11:05 AM														"07/Jul/16 6:32 PM;mwe;Analysis by [~tsu] and [~mwe]:

In the app.js the translationProvider is configured with a custom loader. The custom loader adds iteraplan feature names to the translations additionally to the locale.json files.



If we use the translation api $translationProvider.translations('en', {'key': 'value'}) in the app.js file instead of the custom loader the translations will be added as expected."	"08/Jul/16 6:49 PM;pma;* open problem: a custom loader has to be registered for using it. Registration of custom loader does not work if we integrate filemanager app, e.g. while debugging, you don't get in the file mmlocalizationloader at all. All in all, the file mmlocalizationloader itself seems to be fine. 

* current solution for the translation of the static data: {code}$translationProvider.translations('en', {object from json file});{code}

* for the translation of the dynamic data I've not found a solution yet..

* I've tried out the following methods which didn't work:

** added translation configuration to the FileManagerModule.js

** Tried out following methods from angular-translate which could extend the translation of file manager: use,  useUrlLoader, useStaticFilesLoader (directly in app.config(trans) because we can't register mmlocalizationloader), translations, usePartialLoader

** it seems that only the method translation adds translation-tables. But I've not found out yet how to ""get"" the translations of the custom loader
