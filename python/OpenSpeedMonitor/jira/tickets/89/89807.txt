Dear Mr. Robinson, 

thank you for your enquiry. 

The behaviour of displaying the entire ""technical components"" in the dropdown list is intended.
A concrete attribute like ""retired""  has no influence on the drop down list.

 The following can be done: rename a retired technical components like TC1 to Z_RETIRED_TC1.
 Afterwards the renamed Z_RETIRED_TC1 is displayed in the dropdown list.

You can also delete the ""retired"" objects to clear the list of technical components. 

Greetings,

Christoph Stangl - iteraplan Support"
