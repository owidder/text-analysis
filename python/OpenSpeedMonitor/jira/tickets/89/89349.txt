Can you help me? "		Technical question	iteraplan Support	04/Jul/16 6:29 PM	30/Jul/16 7:00 AM														"06/Jul/16 11:26 AM;iteraplan-support;Dear Mr Kennedy,

Thank you for your notification.

Could you please send us the ant error log files mentioned in the error messages so that we can analyze your problem more easily?

The log files can usually be found in the directory of the iteraplan installer and are named like 'ant.install.log'. Otherwise please check the temp directory of the installation for log files. This should be 'C:\Users\A-BKEN~1\AppData\Local\Temp\1\antinstall14' according to the messages you have sent us.

Best regards,
Manuel Schreyer - iteraplan support"	"06/Jul/16 4:48 PM;brendan.kennedy@aeso.ca;I've attached the log file.   Thank you for your help!

thank you for the iteraplan log file. But we would also need the log file created by Ant, which is the part where the installation crashes. This log file is usually named like *ant.install.log* and can be found in the directory of the iteraplan installer.

Thank you.

Best regards,
Manuel Schreyer - iteraplan support"	"07/Jul/16 11:48 PM;brendan.kennedy@aeso.ca;Here is the log I found.

thank you for sending us the log file. Unfortunatly, also the messages in this file are very unspecific and do not say much about the origin of the error.

Could you send us the content of the left output tab (not the error tab but the other one) which is shown in the installer at the very end?

Thank you very much.

Best regards,
Manuel Schreyer - iteraplan support"
