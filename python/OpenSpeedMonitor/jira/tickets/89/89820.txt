thank you for your enquiry. 

Would you please give me Name of our customer and the following LOG-Files so we can check the problem.

From the conf-directory of your Tomcat-Installation:

* server.xml
* web.xml

 The “catalina.out” and “localhost.log” files from your tomcat installation (just for the period, when the error occurred).
 From [Tomcat]/webapps/[iteraplan directory]/WEB-INF/classes:

* log4j.properties

 From [Tomcat]/webapps/[iteraplan directory]/META-INF:
 
* context.xml (This file can contain passwords -> please remove the passwords)*
 
The iteraplan log files from the period, when the error occurred. The files are called “iteraplan-[version].log” (for today) or „iteraplan-[version].log.[TIMESTAMP]” (for past days). The location of these file was specified during installation and is documented in the file “log4j.properties”.

Greetings,

thank you for sending us the log files. 

To continue the analysis we need the files ""iteraplan-[version].log"", ""iteraplan-[version].log.[TIMESTAMP]"" and the 
""localhost_access_log.[TIMESTAMP].txt"".

A Screenshot with the exact error message on login page would be very helpful.

As I told you, the installation process was ok, and tomcat is up and running but the login page does not load.

The logs I sent you are with timestamp.

Let me know how we proceed"	"13/Jul/16 4:54 PM;cst;Dear Sir / Madam,

the tomcat is starting as you described it.

We need the ""*iteraplan.logs*"" to check why the software is not loading the login page.
Without these we cannot verify your Problem and in your ZIP-File these logs are not include. 
The location of these file was specified during installation and is documented in the file “log4j.properties”.

Is the login screen White or does it show any error? A Screenshot on login page woud be very helpful.

"	"14/Jul/16 3:28 PM;admin@mcongroup.net;Dear Christoph, I've attached the iteraplan log and a screenshot.

Cannot attach empty file iteraplan-5.2.0-login.csv.
Cannot attach empty file iteraplan-5.2.0-nc.log.
Cannot attach empty file iteraplan-5.2-audit.log.

[^iteraplan-5.2.0.log] _(38 kB)_"	"15/Jul/16 12:36 PM;cst;Dear Sir / Madam,

thank you for sending us the missing information.

Woud you please connect to the tomcat server and open these URL'S locally:

http://localhost:8081/yourinstancename
https://localhost:8443/yourinstancename

Will now the login page be displayed, or is the page white again?

When the Page is displayed only with http and port 8081, check the ""<connector>"" configuration in the server.xml. 
The reason can be found in the missing adjustments for https and port 8443. 

Did you reinstall the tomcat before the update 5.1 -> 5.2 or is it the same version and instance as 5.1? 

If this does not work, please send us the ""localhost_access_log.[TIMESTAMP].txt"" to further isolate the error.

Greetings,
