List should be loaded faster	"h1. Timebox: 1 PD to analyse the actual performance



On Chrome:



For 3000 rows, the time for setting up the list, adding columns and reordering them as well as filtering with the quickfilter is ok.

(one has to wait, but not very long)

For 3500 Rows setting up the list (RowDataBuilder.getRowData()) takes more then 1 min (compared to about 10s with 3000 rows, with smaller numbers of rows the increase of the running time something like linear).

For setting up all 4670 IS more than 20 min were not enough.



The difference between in and excluding the RelEnds is very small.

I have a timeline for loading the 3000 entries.



One problems seems to be at the end of the RowData Builder or that the Row Data builder stops the generation of rows at a certain point.





With the internet Explorer:



the maximum seems to be around 1000 rows (sometimes its working, sometimes not), then adding and deleting columns is also working in



Here the functions after the row data builder are also slower.

Please also test the tree view with at least 3000 rows"		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	06/Jul/16 1:16 PM	23/May/17 8:31 AM														06/Jul/16 1:18 PM;aan;This ticket follows ITERAPLAN-4592.	27/Mar/17 2:37 PM;fka;Anything still to do?	23/May/17 8:28 AM;viol;All result are added in attachment "Ip List Perf Test.docx"	23/May/17 8:32 AM;dmkh;Review is done, great job!
