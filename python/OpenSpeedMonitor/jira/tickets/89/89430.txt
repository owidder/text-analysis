Subscribing for Events	"* scripts should have the _plugin container api object_ injected to the js scope

* this _subscribeFor('buildingblockType', reactionFunction)_ method subscribes for change events on instances of buildingBlockType (like in continous elastic update)

* on corresponding event: the specified reactionFunction should be invoked with change event (empty event at first)

* event should contain information about changes



see simple reaction script in wiki
