Remove diagram title (also from all downloads)	"*For all existing diagrams: N3CD, IFD, LSD (in MPD it was already removed):*



* Remove the diagram title from diagram and all downloads

* Put the actual timestamp (date + time) to the bottom of the legend in a small font



I would prefer a clean solution by removing all occurences of the title
