Get rid of 1500ms timeouts in the headerDownloadService.js	"In the current implementation we call diagram redraw and then wait 1.5 sec for it to be drawn and then save it:



{code}

controller.redrawDiagram(true, false); //draws the diagram without size limits

window.setTimeout(function () {

   // save diagram to file

}, 1500);

{code}



Investigate if it's possible to get rid of these timeouts and use callback or event which is triggered when diagram is actually drawn, e.g. {{LayoutCompleted}}  (http://gojs.net/latest/api/symbols/DiagramEvent.html)"		Improvement	iteraplan Thunderduck	01/Jul/16 3:53 PM	20/Jan/17 11:40 AM					diagram	newClient								20/Jan/17 11:40 AM;mse;Timeouts could not be removed completely but are set to 150 ms instead of 1500 ms.
