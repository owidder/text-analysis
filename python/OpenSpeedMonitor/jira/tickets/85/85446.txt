Sort cell values of multiple value columns	"multiple values in a single cell must be sorted ascending, 

for example: 1, 14, 26,

not: 14, 1, 26



multiple values within one cell of type enum should be sorted by enum rank, and then (as text) joined with comma-space."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	25/May/16 4:30 PM
