Dashboard does not work if an attribute with type enum has a value with a single quote	"If an attribute is defined with type enum and there exist a value with a single quote (e.g. O'Brian) and the value is used by a building block then the dashboard visualisations does no longer work correctly.

This is a general bug. It's also not working for the releases 5.*"		Fault	iteraplan Support	25/May/16 10:00 AM	18/Jun/16 7:00 AM														"30/May/16 1:59 PM;tam;Dear Mr. Haberhauer,

I could reproduce the issue you reported to us.

However the dashboard in the classic client won't be developed anymore, because we will be build the new one in the interactive client in the next releases.

As a workaround I can only suggest not to use speicial characters in the enum values.

With best regards,
Timur Ametov
