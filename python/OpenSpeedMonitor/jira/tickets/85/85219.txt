Additional Date Intervals	"*Summary:*

Include addtional date intervals as new bars.

*Intermediate solution for now: Every bar is in a new row*



*As-Is:*

* Only one date interval for each level is possible



*To-Be:*

* For each level multiple date intervals, i.e. multiple bars are possible.



*Implementation Details:*

* Every new bar creates a new row (will be improved later for less rows)

* The date intervals are specific for each level

* The coloring (default or attribute-based) of the level is also applied to these new date intervals

* There is no maximum number of additional date intervals

* The additional date intervals are shown in the legend and saved in the url



*UI:*

* Toolarea:

** Main entry: ""-Addtional- Date intervals""

** First sub-entries: ""Level 1"", ""Level 2"" (if exists), ""Level 3"" (if exists)

** Sub-sub-entry: All available date intervals (=duration attributes) ordered alphabetically

* The actual selected date interval is highlighted in bold

* When you re-click on an already selected date interval, this date interval is removed from the diagram

* You cannot remove all date intervals, i.e. one date interval is at least selected

* -When you add a new date interval, the ""Begin"" and ""End"" columns are added, too-

* The legend and url show *all* date intervals
