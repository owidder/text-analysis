Coloring of header and less borderlines in the table grid	"*Summary:*

Use the Building-Block-Type colors (like in the legend) in a brighter version and same indention for the header of the table.

Use less borderlines:

* -borderlines around the whole diagram- (Update below)

* One borderline between the header of the table and the table itself

* No borderlines between columns in the table

* No borderlines in the header of the table

* -Zebra stripes for the rows in the table (not in the header, not in the right diagram, i.e. date-range-diagram)- (Update below)



* Borderlines for the columns in date-range-diagram

* No borderlines for the rows in the date-range-diagram



*As-Is:*

* Headers are colored in different grey tones.



*To-Be:*

* -Building Block Types are colored in ""their"" Building Block color (with more white used)-

* Level 2 and Level 3 use the same indention
