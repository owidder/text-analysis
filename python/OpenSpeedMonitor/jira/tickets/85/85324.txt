Analyze color and line style decoration and design unification (incl. Prototype)	"analyze all current implementations of coloring and line style for links/arrows and border lines



design a solution with unified code for all diagrams

design local adapters if needed



The result of this ticket is the input into 4430.



Result of analysis looks like this:

* for each (different) implementation, that is per diagram, at least one structure/collaboration diagram with all classes, controllers and so on.

* for each element in this overview diagram a short text/paragraph with its name, responsibilty, and interactions with its neighbors.



after this, the to-be design looks the same (overview diagram, and text with description of each element), and a plan how to change/replace things so that we go from existing to designed solution."
