Reordering triggers change of column ordering in ListConfiguration	Don't rerender the columnDefs and rowData.	83747	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	23/May/16 4:21 PM	07/Jun/16 11:31 AM														"25/May/16 4:17 PM;mwe;From ag-grid website:

""Sorting API



Sorting can be controlled via the Sorting API via the following methods:



setSortModel(sortModel): To set the sort.

getSortModel(): To return the state of the currently active sort.

Both methods work with a list of sort objects, each object containing a sort field and direction. *The order of the sort objects depicts the order in which the columns are sorted.*""

See: [https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-sorting/index.php]"	"06/Jun/16 1:26 PM;tam;Once a column was reodered, the list of columns to be add (in +Add column) seems to be reseted.

That means, at the begining there are only id and name columns. There are no id and name values in the list from +Add column. If you reorder these both columns, you immediately see both values in the list.

However if you refresh the page, the list seems to be correct again.



Another defect. In the IS-view add column ""Costs"" and reorder it. Then delete it. The column ""id"" disappeared instead of the ""Costs"".

"	06/Jun/16 4:14 PM;mwe;Fixed both possible defects (reordering affects list of addable columns, false deletion of reordered column).	07/Jun/16 11:31 AM;tam;Reviewed and tested.
