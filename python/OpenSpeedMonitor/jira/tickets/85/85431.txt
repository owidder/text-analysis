"	14/Jun/16 3:08 PM;abo;Follow-up Ticket: ITERAPLAN-4713	"15/Jun/16 10:29 AM;mse;There are two different problems now (not sure if they were really caused by this bug fix):



# Select an attribute or an operator in the filter dialog: If you try to change the selection, the dropdown menu only contains the selected value. It is not possible to change the filter (see screenshot 1)

# Make the steps from the ticket description: After reopening the filter dialog, the text field contains ""CRM"" but the attribute and operator selection has disappeared (see screenshot 2).



Both issues seem to be connected with patches in external libraries.
