Commit-friendly configuration	"Look into all configuration mechanisms (mostly files) for the new interactive client,

so that one can have (at least 2) variants at the same time:



* public variant, as in a clean freshly pulled working copy, valid for all subsequent build stages (Jenkins...)

* local variant, taking precedence over the public settings



It must be easy to divide the public config files and the local ones into two commit groups.



It must be hard to confuse local and global config files.



If there is a clear and easy solution, implement it at once in the scope of this ticket.

If there are complicated solutions, or none, document and discuss.
