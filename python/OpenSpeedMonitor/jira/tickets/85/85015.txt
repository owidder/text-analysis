Handle permissions when opening URL with configuration	"Currently user does not have an ability to select the building block type he does not have permissions for from the tool area.

But he can receive a link with the configuration, which includes such building block types.

In such case we should check the permissions for each of levels and if at least one permission is missing don't display diagram, but show appropriate message in case when user cannot use the particular building block type.



Message: Please do not use a pop-up. Display the message for missing permission directly in the Diagram, like ""No elements to display"" in the Information Flow Diagram.



Use a message locale-xx.js:

""PERMISSION_WARNING"": ""diagram can't be displayed due to permissions"","		Improvement	iteraplan PO	20/May/16 10:35 AM	01/Jun/16 4:36 PM					masterplan									"30/May/16 4:55 PM;msr;I like the code.
