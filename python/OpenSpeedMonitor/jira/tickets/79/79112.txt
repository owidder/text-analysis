Create sceleton implementation of the diagram	"Create a sceleton implementation of the whole diagram,

i.e. create all rudimentary files stated in the architecture diagram (without any functionality) and all connections to each other



Take the already implemented ""N3CD""-Diagram or Information Flow Diagram as blueprint. Both have a similar architecture."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	05/Apr/16 11:39 AM	10/Jun/16 3:24 PM														"02/May/16 5:02 PM;msr;The code and style looks really good. Thank you.

Please find addtionally some review-comments:



app/js/mpd/mpdConfiguration.js:

* line 14: Please specify ""object"" - ""object"" is too generic

* line 25+26: The property ""this.defaultContentItemColor"" is not constant because of colorpicker. Rename it to ""colorForNotAssigned"" and add it as configurationParameter to each level

* line 37: Do not set any additional column as default, i.e. additionalColumns: []

* line 39-47: Please remove level 2

* line 72-79: Please remove generic getter

* line 84: Please specify, e.g. {!string[]} - list of persistent names of date intervals (=durations)

* line 84: Please add @public

* line 139: JSDoc needs to be more specified, e.g. @public, @method, concrete types instead of ""Array"" or ""Object""



app/js/mpd/mpdContent/mpdContentController.js:

* line 17: add MpdContentMain to jsHint-WhiteList

* line 20: toolAreaViewState should be hold in the configuration -> please get it from there

* line 32: What do you think about putting the private functions to the end of each super-function?"	12/May/16 1:45 PM;roia;@Marcel, I have updated JSDoc and moved private functions to the bottom. From my point of view, this task is done.	"05/Jun/16 11:05 AM;msr;First review comments already implemented by [~roia]. Thanks.
