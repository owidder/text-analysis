Fulltext search in Classic Client shows unexpected results	"Timebox: 1
IS:
# browse to iteraplan classic client
# enter '@' in the fulltext-search-box in the upper right menu-area
# the result list contains BB where the ""found in"" column is empty. When you open such a BB it is not tracable why this entry is part of the results

See: SearchServiceImpl.executeSearchQuery() line 230:
{{luceneQuery = luceneQuery.rewrite(reader);}}
Obviously the luceneQuery uses attributes with (partially) non-printable characters that also contain '@'.
Seems the change of handling the search-string is _not_ the reason for the different behavior - the problem already is reproduceable with Rev #25391 (need to recreate the search-index!). Maybe it was introduced with lib-upgrades (Hibernate 3->4, Lucene 3.x -> 5.x)

SHOULD:
Only BB with _real matches_ should be shown.


-Probably this is an encoding issue. Check that.- Not an encoding issue - switched to version 5.1.0 and it works.
"		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	05/Apr/16 12:55 PM	05/Dec/16 2:52 PM					classic	search								"28/Nov/16 6:38 PM;ants;Date properties now are indexed as String values by HS (using GMT timezone) with resolution set to DAY. Custom date processing that includes managing user timezone should be implemented after requirements for it would be specified.

Using of lucene ""AND"" and ""OR"" keywords was reenabled by removing surrounding ""*"", that were added to every word of user query in scope of ITERAPLAN-4217.

More detailed requirements for possible lucene-like syntax in queries should be specified if needed."	05/Dec/16 2:52 PM;mada;Review done wtih https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-206#CFR-35693
