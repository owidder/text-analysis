Analyse GoJS API for a Masterplan Diagram	"*Summary:*

Create a small prototype with the help of GoJS (http://gojs.net/latest/index.html) for a diagram with a ""table""-Layout



*Details:*

You could e.g. use this table example of GoJS: http://gojs.net/latest/intro/tablePanels.html



Find attached an example from the masterplan diagram of the classic iteraplan. The prototype should consist of 5 columns for data and the following columns for a month of a year (in our example 48 narrow rows).



Please get in contact with [~wfr] and ask for his experience.



Finally present the result to [~wfr]"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	05/Apr/16 11:44 AM	05/Jun/16 4:01 PM														"26/Apr/16 2:09 PM;msr;New requirement panning:

Extend the prototype for the new requirement of panning of ""bars"", i.e.

* create two different GoJS-diagrams - one for the ""text"" and one for the ""bars""

* Create a prototype with height more than one browser page to test scrolling up and down, i.e. with a vertical scrollbar on the right for the whole diagram

* To keep both diagrams vertically in synch, implement two Diagram Event Listeners on both diagrams. They should listen to ""ViewportBoundsChanged"""
