Filter Interfaces	"*Summary:*

Filter interfaces with the help of the combinedFilter.



*As-Is:*

Only Information Systems are filtered at the moment.



*To-Be:*

Information Systems and Interfaces can be filtered.



*Affected JS-Files:*

* ifdToolAreaViewModelBuilder

* ifdConfiguration

* ifdDataService

* ifdController

* ifdLegendMain (potentially)

* ifdLegendBuilder (potentially)



* PersistentName of Interfaces (can be hard-coded) is ""InformationFlow""



*Acceptance criteria:*

* User opens toolarea for nodes or for edges or for edges & nodes

* A new toolarea entry ""Edge Filter"" occurs ""Node Filter""

* After clicking on ""Edit filter"" the CombinedFilter-Template opens

* After selecting one or mulitple filters, the diagram is immediately filtered and redrawn, the legend is updated as well as the url"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	06/Apr/16 1:57 PM	18/Jul/16 9:45 AM														"11/Jul/16 12:39 PM;dmkh;??PersistentName of Interfaces (can be hard-coded) is ""InformationSystemInterface""??

As I see in {{ifdDataService.js}} persistent name of edges is ""InformationFlow"". So I implemented filtering using this one and it seems to work well. 



??User opens toolarea for nodes or for edges(=link) or toolarea for edges & nodes (=both)??

Added Edge Filter to all toolareas, as Node Filter is, so if user adds filtering for edges he still can undo or edit Edge Filter settings. 

Even if all edges are filtered and Edge Filter Entry is not displayed for any selection type.



[~msr], can I use the implementation described above and update description of the ticket?
