Let local.conf.js completely overwrite conf.js	"*IS:*

For running local UI-tests it is necessary to create and customize _local.conf.js_ AND you need to adapt the property _seleniumAddress_ of _conf.js_, which is checked-in into SVN but must not be changed to execute tests on Jenkins.

BTW: remove commented-out code in _conf.js_."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	08/Mar/16 10:46 AM						nic	protractor
