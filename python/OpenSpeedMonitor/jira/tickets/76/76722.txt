Import does not read attributes with square brackets in their name	"_Reproduce:_

# Create new attribute with square brackets in its name, for example ""test [test]""

# Assign the attribute to a building block type, for example Architectural domain

# Export Excel data

# In the Excel file, enter some valid values in the column of the new attribute and save

# Import Excel file



_Expected:_ Attribute values set for the according building blocks

_Actual:_ Attribute values were ignored



_Reason:_ In {{XlsStructuredTypeMapper#findFeatureIndices(Sheet)}}, square brackets are not handled correctly. It is assumed, that there is exactly one pair of square brackets in a Excel column feature header, for the cardinality meta information."
