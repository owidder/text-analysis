Inner-Outer relationship selection	"Add selection of the specific relationship between inner and outer type to the according tool area:

* Outer tool area: All possible relationships (2-3 hops) from outer to inner type listed in an extra tool area menu

* Inner tool area: All possible relationships (2-3 hops) from inner to outer type listed in an extra tool area menu



Possibly also in this ticket or as subtask: Re-implement the calculation of possible relationships between outer and inner type based on the new metamodel classes.

Currently, the calculation is done in the data model and based on the old meta data structure.

It should be moved to the n(3)cd folder, as it is only needed for that diagram."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	11/Mar/16 9:09 AM	22/Apr/16 10:08 AM														"14/Apr/16 2:54 PM;mwe;The following commits processed during working on the wrong ticket [ITERAPLAN-4390] are part of this ticket, too:
