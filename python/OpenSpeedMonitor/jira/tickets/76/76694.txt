mass-update of relations	"what is the best way to perform a mass-update of relations?  for example, i need to update the relation between 500 systems to a business function.  The options that I know are:



1. assign the relation one-by-one by editing a system element and assigning or correcting the respective business function.  this takes approx. 30 sec. per element.  that means about 4 hours of busy work if i don't make any mistakes or click too quickly (clicking too quickly creates error messages)

2. cannot use the ""business mapping"" function.  it does not support the business function elements

3. cannot use the ""bulk update"" function.  relations can be queried but cannot be edited (only attributes can be edited).

4. cannot use the database export/import function.  it does not work.  see problem request IPS-31.  waiting for a solution.



what other option can i use, other than nr. 1?"		Technical question	iteraplan Support	10/Mar/16 10:35 PM	18/Mar/16 9:22 AM														"11/Mar/16 8:42 AM;sfe;A bulk update for relations should be possible, see also here:

As for the mass data export/import function:

As far as I understood, export currently does not work for the complete data or when you select Systems as type to be exported.

As workaround, maybe it works if you select Business Functions for export, and add the new relations there."	11/Mar/16 1:30 PM;hannes.callisen@boehringer-ingelheim.com;thank you.  i will try it again.  maybe i did something else differently.	16/Mar/16 2:03 PM;sfe;Hello, did you encounter any further issues regarding your relations update?	17/Mar/16 10:10 PM;hannes.callisen@boehringer-ingelheim.com;I am able to work again.  thank you.
