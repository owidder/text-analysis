Performance Workshop Follow-Up (Client)	"Activities from the performance workshop on Mar 4.



* add code style rule, rework existing code: named functions instead of anonymous, because better call stack analysis (bottom up) (?)

* do not use obsolete no-cache header, use modern headers instead

* important: build an index from ID to raw JSON data of building blocks

* replace explicit getter bb.name with implicit property access or with a hard coded getter, do not use dynamic defineGetter/Setter per object

* use non-debug variant of GoJS for production _and_ for performance analysis

* use GZIP filter in Tomcat (done)

* preload all BusinessObjects instead of on-demand (maybe, is to evaluate)

* do not use debugger statement in production code, add style rule, add static check

* break up transformation into small chunks with setTimeOut, WebWorker or similar (later)

* Performance regression tests with Phantomas browser (later)"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	09/Mar/16 10:38 AM
