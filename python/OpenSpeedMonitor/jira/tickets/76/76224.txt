iteratec service desk GUI	"when clicking on the ""iteratec Service Desk"" label at the top-left of the screen, the options to report an issue are not shown (see attached screenshot).  I have to logout and then login to be able to submit a request.

We are using IE9, if that means anything.

You don't need to log out. If you click on 'iteraplan support', you will be able to see all options and send a report."	"08/Mar/16 2:45 PM;hannes.callisen@boehringer-ingelheim.com;hello Timur .. understood.  thanks.
but then why does it say on the screen ""You can raise a support request from the options provided below"" and there are no options and i'm supposed to click on ""iteraplan support""?  
just a suggestion to clean-up the wording.  you can close this ticket."	"08/Mar/16 2:52 PM;tam;Thank you for your suggestion. 



Unfortunately the same message will be used both on the page from your screenshot and on the support page itselfs.
