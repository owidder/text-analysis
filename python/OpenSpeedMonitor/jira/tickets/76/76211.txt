Cleanup dependency-usage	"*IS:*

* a bower configuration exists and is checked into SVN

* the downloaded bower components are checked into SVN, too

* _bower install_ is _not_ part of the grunt build

* still some libs in _iteraplan-9/app/js/libs_ folder



*BACKGROUND:*

The dependencies are checked into SVN because the online source for their resolution is not reliable (WFR) .



*SHOULD:*

* now libs-folder (dependencies should be managed by bower only)

* dependencies are defined in bower-config

* the path to dependencies should be nicer than 'bower-components' (e.g. 'libs')

* dependencies are _not_ checked in

* resolving dependencies is part of the (grunt-) build

* we use a company repository to proxy and share used dependencies (is this possible with the nexus-installation we already have?)

* analyze if the same can be done with the checked-in node-modules
