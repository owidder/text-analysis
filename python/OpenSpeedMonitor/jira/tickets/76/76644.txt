That was the reason for SQL errors you've got. When initializing a database, the Installer first attempts to delete existing tables from the database. If a new schema is being created for the database (meaning no tables as yet exist for iteraplan), the Installer issues an error message stating that it is unable to locate the tables to delete. You can safely ignore this message here. (see [http://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan51/iteraplan+installer])"	23/Mar/16 7:26 AM;asingh3@csir.co.za;hi guys how do I close this request as solved?	23/Mar/16 10:15 AM;tam;We closed this Ticket as Done
