Create page object for the filter dialog (needed for E2E tests)	"Create an object which provides methods to interact with

the new filter dialog.

Make it sufficiently generic, so that it can be used without modifications in either

of the diagram-specific E2E tests.



Put it into: "".\tests\e2etest\helpers""

You can find examples of page objects there
