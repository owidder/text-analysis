HAS TO BE FIXED:

* switching between enum and numeric attribute doesnt work, e.g. :

  if you select an enum attribute for the inner items and a numeric attribute for the outer items, the inner items are colored in the default color again while the outer are colored correctly..

-> ncdItemDecorator"	"22/Apr/16 11:37 AM;sfe;Please make sure that system attributes like ""ID"" and ""position"" are not available for coloring.

Take a look at the Landscape Diagram, which already offers coloring by numeric attributes and most likely has a possibility to filter out the unwanted attributes."	26/Apr/16 12:43 PM;tam;'HAS TO BE FIXED' is fixed :)	"26/Apr/16 12:45 PM;tam;/trunk/app/js/n3cd/ncdConfiguration.js

	Why 5? And what for?

	this.configurationParameters.numberOfNumericFields = 5;"	26/Apr/16 1:09 PM;mwe;numberOfNumericFields won't be fixed right now, because there is a refactoring task already: [ITERAPLAN-4430]
