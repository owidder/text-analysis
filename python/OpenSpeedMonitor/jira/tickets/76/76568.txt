issues with full-text search	"we are experiencing a couple of issues with the full-text search within a building block.



Case 1: searching for the partial string ""ces"" yields a ""could not execute query"" error message.  See attached screenshots for case 1A and case 1B.



Case 2: searching with only one partial word works fine (see attached case 2A).  searching a string where the second word is partial, yields zero results (see attached case 2B).  if the second word is spelled-out completely, then it works again (see attached case 2C).



Are these known restrictions that we need to be aware of and live as is or can we expect a fix/enhancement?"		Fault	iteraplan Support	10/Mar/16 12:04 AM	21/Mar/16 1:42 PM														"10/Mar/16 12:04 AM;hannes.callisen@boehringer-ingelheim.com;

Case 3:  using the condition ""contains"" yields all elements that contain that value in the attribute.  this is good.  attached case 3A shows all elements that include the value CHC.  if we want to search for elements that have only the value CHC, we tried to use the ""is"" condition.  however, we get the same result set as the ""contains"" query (see attached case 3B).  so what is the difference between ""is"" and ""contains"" ?

I'm sorry for the late reply.
Here an update regarding your three cases:
* I cannot say anything about case 1 yet. The analysis for that case is yet to be finished.
* Case two is a known issue, there is a defect ticket in our development system for it and we plan to fix this for the coming release of iteraplan. The development ticket in question can be found here: https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/jira/browse/ITERAPLAN-4217
* In case three the difference between ""contains"" and ""is"" is relevant for usage of the free text input field. With ""contains"" you can enter a partial term in the free text input and still find the according system. For example:
** Both ""line of business *contains* CHC"" and ""line of business *is* CHC"" return all building blocks which have a value ""CHC"" assigned.
** ""line of business *contains* CH"" also returns building blocks which have a value ""CHC"" assigned, but ""line of business *is* CH"" does not return building blocks with the value ""CHC"" (except if there also exists a value ""CH"" they have assigned additionally).
** In general in the query mask, whenever there is a case of possible multi value assignments (for example an attribute as in your example), the semantics are as follows: Return all building blocks which have at least one value assigned for which the given condition is true.
In your case ""Return all building blocks which have at least one 'line of business' value which contains/is 'CHC'""."	15/Mar/16 1:04 PM;hannes.callisen@boehringer-ingelheim.com;thank you for explaining the use of "is" and "contains"	16/Mar/16 2:06 PM;sfe;Regarding case 1: Please attach an iteraplan problem report for the observed issue (download link for the problem report can be found on the error page. Users with the role iteraplan_Supervisor or a related role can download the report). Without the additional information I was not able to reproduce the effect so far.

[^catalina.2016-03-16.log] _(50 kB)_"	"17/Mar/16 12:57 PM;sfe;It seems you are using MS SQL Server. There is a known bug in iteraplan related to large result sets of queries in combination with SQL Server. This bug will be fixed in the coming iteraplan release in April.
In the meantime, please try as workaround to use the ""Queries"" tab on the overview pages, if you know which property you are looking for.
If, for example, you want to list all Systems which have ""ces"" in their name, you can express that as query on the Queries tab.
Unfortunately, if you want to list all Systems which have ""ces"" assigned in some unspecified way (like ""name, description or some user defined attribute""), I cannot offer you a workaround right now."	17/Mar/16 10:09 PM;hannes.callisen@boehringer-ingelheim.com;I'm looking forward to the new version.
