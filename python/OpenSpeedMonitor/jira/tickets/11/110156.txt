Handling for not critical attribute type misses	"- if an no longer existing attribute is chosen for a not critical configuration feature, the configuration should be migrated without this feature



- example:

- costs is chosen for coloring in lsd.

- costs is removed

- diagram should be migrated with default coloring



- AXIS is the only feature type (see class Usage in SavedQueryMigrationUtils) that is critical at the moment. "		Improvement	iteraplan PO	31/Jan/17 4:23 PM	07/Feb/17 4:15 PM
