History	"Hi



our current version is Corporate Edition v5.2.0-r25485

- the history function is currently not enabled (maybe it was once in the past ??)



We want to upgrade to the newest 5.5 release.



What is the best approach to enable the history function from now on?



Thanks Martin Eberle"		Technical question	iteraplan Support	14/Mar/17 12:20 PM	03/Apr/17 7:00 AM														"14/Mar/17 1:15 PM;cst;Dear Mr. Eberle,

thank you for your inquiry. 

The simplest way to activate the history is upgrade to version 5.5 of iteraplan.
In iteraplan 5.5 can the history enabled in the ui. 

When you want activate the history function in version 5.2 the first step is to check if the history was activated in the past. 

- If the history was activated, you can enable this feature in the ""iteraplan.propierties""
- If the history was not activated, you must execute this database script [History initialization|https://forum.iteraplan.de/forum/client-area/downloads-database-scripts/33-history-initialization]

Please note, when you update with a activate old history to version 5.5, you must execute the history migration tool to transfer the old history in the redesigned history of the current iteraplan.

Is there a way to reset it and then just enable it in 5.5 without migration?""

-------------------------------------------

Yes this is possible, after upgrading on version 5.5. you can activate the history without migration. 
The old history will be ignored and the software starts with a ""clean"" history.

_Thanks for the clarification. Last question to the upgrade from current 5.2 to 5.5_
 * _Is it sufficient to start with the installerof 5.5 or do we need to go / read / apply any intermediate step (e.g. 5.3, 5.4 and then 5.5)?_
 * _Of course I would apply the db upgrade scripts in the correct order (packaged with the 5.5 installer)_
 * _So, do we need to download any other (intermediate/previous version) installer and follow those instructions before applying 5.5?_

 __ 

_Later we’d like to check the docker containerized version. Where do we get this from?_

_Can that be installed in parallel and then make mass export / import to this environment to check if it works with our data?_

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Hello Martin,

thank you for your reply.

To upgrade from version 5.2 to 5.5.you must upgrade your db with the scripts for 5.2 to 5.3 - 5.3 to 5.4 and 5.4 to 5.5.
You need only to install the iteraplan version 5.5. 

The updatescripts are all in the current download package included. You will find them in the folder ""upgrade"".

On the next weeks we release a docker containerized version of iteraplan 5.5. When you succesfully start your docker container, it is possible to import a dump of your database in the ""docker"" mysql database. You can operate with both systems parallel.
