Refactor NCD configuration URL reading	"We use {{queryParams = queryProcessor.read();}} to read the URL and 



{{queryProcessor.setParametersToUrl(queryParams);}} to write it.



Looks like this does not work well with storing complex objects, like coloring, etc.



I'd suggest that we rewrite it with the use of 



{{queryProcessor.readUrlAsObject()}} and {{queryProcessor.writeObjectToUrl()}}



Also, when we process the URL, we loop:



{{for (var param in queryParams)}}  , but inside the loop we check the



{{that.configurationParameters}} . For me it looks inconsistent and leads to incorrect URLs stored, which later cannot be restored and produce errors.
