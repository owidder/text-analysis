 * what if a relation is Business Mapping - business mappings are non-editable fields, so there is no possibility to edit those

 * in relations with multiple values we need additional checkboxes in the same column as those attributes are !relation_checkbox.PNG!"	28/Mar/17 2:38 PM;roia;[~msr], [~mkt], it's not clear what for checkboxes are (from the previous comment)	"29/Mar/17 9:41 AM;mkt;Don't we have only one type of checkboxes in use? 

In my opinion, the same as we use in the first column."	29/Mar/17 10:53 AM;vadm;[~mkt], what functionality these checkboxes should perform, how they should be used? 	"29/Mar/17 11:27 AM;mkt;Those should be activated when main checkbox (in first column is active)



For relations we have several data separately editable and with mass update we probably don't want to change all of those to the same value (i.e. apportionment), that is why we need to have this possibility to choose which fields should be changed in the situation then there are more than one (in this case servers)"	03/Apr/17 11:27 AM;vadm;Checkboxes functionality was separated in https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/jira/browse/IPTS-746
