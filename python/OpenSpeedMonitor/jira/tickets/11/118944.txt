[~mkt], [~msr], is it OK that colors will be different than in the other parts of application? I have implemented the colors mentioned in the task description, you can see the implementation in current trunk."	"02/May/17 4:29 PM;vadm;[~mkt], [~msr], do we really need message ""All input will be lost. Do you want to continue?"" in Boolean editor, when we try to close it?



!image-2017-05-02-17-29-05-594.png!"	"02/May/17 4:44 PM;mkt;As there is no input, I would say: ""All changes will be lost. Do you want to continue?"" (german: ""Alle Änderungen gehen verloren. Möchten Sie fortfahren?"")

We need to warn the user, that we won't save/change anything in case of leaving current editor.



[~msr], what do you think?"	05/May/17 9:25 AM;msr;[~mkt]: I fully agree :)	05/May/17 11:30 AM;roia;Confirmation message updated in revision *6771*	08/May/17 11:27 AM;vadm;Review is done https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-552
