 * The row should consist of columns selected in current view

 * Every data-type should have separate input field and appropriate buttons to carry out an action (will be described in tickets according to particular input-types)

 * only one value at a time should be editable, other should be inactive

 ** user can't edit further fields until he saves the first one, unless he wants to lose previous data

 ** {color:#ff0000}UPDATE: {color} If user wants lose data, he can click on the cancel-button (described in [#IPTS-605] )

 ** clicking on another filed or [x] shows popup dialog:

 *** All input will be lost. Do you want to continue? (german: ""Die eingetragenen Daten gehen verloren. Möchten Sie fortfahren?"")

 * {color:#ff0000}UPDATE: {color} width, add and remove column should be synchronised to the grid

 * in case of uneditable fields (business mapping, id, last modification user, last modification time) - there is no possibility for user to open input field, those are inactive and grey (#E0E0E0)

[~mkt], [~msr], how this ""he wants"" should be implemented on UI?"	"28/Mar/17 4:51 PM;vadm;Width of ""Business Mapping"" column is not correct (see screenshot).

User can edit only one value at a time, but another columns are not disabled, so he can edit further fields until he saves the first one.

Also I'd suggest to disable columns, which are not editable (e.g. Business Mapping)."	06/Apr/17 4:30 PM;vadm;Review is done https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-471
