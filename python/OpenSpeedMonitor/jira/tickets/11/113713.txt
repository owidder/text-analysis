Implement proper XWiki-parsing for all multiline-textfields in the New Client	"*Summary:*

 Implement proper XWiki-parsing for all multiline-textfields in the New Client



*Actual:*

 * JSCreole is used for parsing the XWiki-Syntax in the New Client

 * BUT JSCreole parses the creole-syntax which is different than the XWiki-Syntax



*Expected:*

 * Ensure that XWiki-Syntax is properly displayed in the New Client

 * [http://lod.springer.com/wiki/bin/view/XWiki/XWikiSyntax?syntax=2.0]



*Solution:*

 * Use XWiki-Parser on the server and take over server-result. This is already implemented in scope of -IPTS-738-

 * Remove JSCreole completely

 * Out of scope: The Building Block Lists and attribute lists: The prototype is built in scope of: -IPTS-837-



*Additionally:*

 * Ensure that the server-xwiki-parser ignores already included html/js-fragements and returns them as escaped characters (to stop XSS)
