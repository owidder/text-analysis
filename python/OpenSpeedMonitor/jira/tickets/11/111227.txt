Contains Not behaviour	"filter with contains not should include elements with undefined values



- how to reproduce:

- open interactive client filter in Information System list view

- filter by Complexity contains not ""high""

PROBLEM: systems with not assigned complexity are not in the list



compare classic client: list contains is which complexity is set (but not high) and all the systems with undefined complexity



todo: fix new client behaviour"		Bug	iteraplan PO	07/Feb/17 7:18 PM	08/Feb/17 4:44 PM														08/Feb/17 4:44 PM;vadm;Review is done https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-349
