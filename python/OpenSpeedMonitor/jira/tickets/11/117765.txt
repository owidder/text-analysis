Mass update of relation "groups" (Server + Client)	"Mass update for attributable relations (relation groups).

UI should consist of normal relation selection dropdown + attribute selection.



All Attribue values of a selected row will have the same value afterwards.



Summary screen should only contain one active option ""current selection"" and two deactivated radio-buttons.



REST requests are *not* send to the original Building Block Type but the relationship-Building Block Type (see list edit).



Server needs to handle that."		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	05/Apr/17 4:51 PM	02/Jun/17 12:40 PM
