Unchangable attribute groups (Server + Client)	"Despite wrong requirements in old tickets, please use this requirement for the updated implementation:

 * Default attribute group: The name and description cannot be changed in the client and on the server - all other fields of this group can be changed

 * All other groups are fully changable

 * {color:red}UPDATE: {color}-Only the default attribute group is fixed on the left side. Server should always return its position as first, to be consistent with frontend. Then custom sorting on frontend can be removed.-

 * Include localisation only for the description of the default attribute group (split description on the backend)"		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	13/Mar/17 11:23 AM	25/Apr/17 2:24 PM														"27/Mar/17 4:09 PM;roia;{quote} * Include localisation only for the description of the default attribute group{quote}

[~msr], currently backend returns both English end German localisations in one field. Should the backend be updated?"	27/Mar/17 4:34 PM;msr;Yes, I have updated the description	28/Mar/17 11:50 AM;roia;Client updated, now backend update is needed	"21/Apr/17 10:49 AM;roia;If groups have been reordered in the classic client their order is not consistent with new client - the [Default] group is not first.



[~msr], how this situation should be handled?



!atg_default_not_first.jpg|thumbnail!"	"21/Apr/17 11:52 AM;roia;[~msr] the customers already have some database with attribute groups, where the default group can be not on first position. I will get the order from the server, where the Default group is not first. Should I place it in new client not at the first position? 



If I should resort on client and make the sorting, which does not match the server's data, then when user resorts, he will send incorrect new position.



My suggestion is that we force server to place the default group always first. Or, maybe, you have some other suggestions."	25/Apr/17 2:24 PM;vadm;Review is done https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-532
