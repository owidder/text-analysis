Deleting an BM in ListView leads to error when changing the view	"Delete a BM in the list view by using the trash can.



Change the view before the response arrives at the new client (use for example a breakpoint in the backend), for example to the start page



Expected behaviour: Everything is fine and the response is used if it is needed and ignored otherwise



Current behaviour: This leads to an error as the function for deleting works with "".then"" and some of the necessary variables are not available anymore



(Does also happen when deleting standalone BOs, for example BusinessObjects)"		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	11/Apr/17 8:38 AM	05/May/17 2:44 PM
