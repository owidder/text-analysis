mandatory relations	"For attributes, it is possible to make their data mantenance mandatory.  

Is it also possible to make the specification of a relation a mandatory feature, for exmaple, at least one system-service relation must exists."		Technical question	iteraplan Support	10/Mar/17 1:41 PM	03/Apr/17 7:00 AM														"15/Mar/17 2:57 PM;cst;Dear Mr. Callisen,

thank you for your inquiry.

At the moment this is not possible to make data mandatory in the attributes. The reason for this, is the fix meta model. 
Alternatively you can use the IterQL to display all elements without the setted relations.

Greetings,
