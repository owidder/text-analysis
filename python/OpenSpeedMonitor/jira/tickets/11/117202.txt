thank you for your inquiry.

You execute the script with the right mouseclick and ""Execute File"".
After that, the URL can be clicked and the result will be shown.

On the follwoing link find you our documentation of the Graphics Reactor:

 "	"31/Mar/17 11:10 AM;michal.klima@infineon.com;I know how to execute the reactor file.

Question is, what must be setup in the reactor script config so
when the user clicks the Dashbouard button he gets the real dashboard.


!home page.png|thumbnail!"	"31/Mar/17 11:13 AM;cst;Ahh okay, this feature is not implemented in version 5.5. 
 The dashboard feature will be availible in version 6.0

To open the executed dashboard in the reactor, you must use the link whitch is created for the output.
These link can be opened from your iteraplan users.
