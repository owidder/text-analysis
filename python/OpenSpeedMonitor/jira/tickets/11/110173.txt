Empty result set while performing search in new client causes JS exceptions.	"AS IS:

When searching query returns empty result set, JS exception appears.

See screenshot.

For empty result set REST API responses plain text string ""Empty result."" with code 200OK, but client expects an array of results.



TO BE:

Proper empty result set handling."		Bug	iteraplan PO	31/Jan/17 6:29 PM	02/Mar/17 5:59 PM
