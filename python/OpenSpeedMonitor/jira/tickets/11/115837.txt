Legend and Colors will not be updated correctly	"Reproduce with trunk and IE 11

 # Open the Pie Chart Diagram 

 # Set ""Content Type"" to ""Project"" and ""Attribute"" to ""Strategic value""

 # Open the ""Legend""

 # Change to ""DATA"" and ""Project"" 

 # Add the column ""Strategic value"" and change one value to e.g 6000  

 # Reopen the PIE Chart Diagram and the colors all the same and the legen is not correct



Expected: That the Diagram will be reloaded and shows the correct coloring / legende

Actual: The coloring does not work and the legend stays the same 



The reason for this are the ranges which will be saved in the URL."		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	22/Mar/17 2:13 PM	04/Apr/17 6:29 PM														"04/Apr/17 6:29 PM;mash;Review is done
