Empty space behind last column when no vertical scrollbar	"Reproduce:



# Go to list view with enough elements so that vertical scrollbar is needed

# Use a quick filter so that only some elements are displayed and no vertical scrollbar is needed



Expected:

* Width of last column before the action column is adjusted correctly



Actual:

* There is an empty space between the last column and the action column (see screenshot)



Start you investigations in ipList-component.js and look at the two methods:

* correctWidthOfLastColumn()

* getVisibleGridWidth()"		Bug	iteraplan PO	02/Feb/17 12:55 PM	09/Feb/17 9:40 AM
