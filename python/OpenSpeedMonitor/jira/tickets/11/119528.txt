Update 5.2 to 5.5	"Hi,



I want to Update my present Iteraplan SQL/iTurm 5.2 Installation to Version 5.5. As I read, I need to install



5.3 then

5.4 then

5.5



Is this correct? I tried to download the prior Versions (5.3/5.4/5.5) with my ""corporate"" User and Password but it´s not working (anymore?).



Could you help me with



1. access to the downloads

2. the right Update path



Thanks in advance,

Simon

thank you for your inquiry. 

You need to install only the current version 5.5, but the update scripts for the database must be executed.
I attached you the upgrade scripts from version 5.3 to 5.5 on this ticket.

In our installation guide you will find additional information to the upgrade process:
