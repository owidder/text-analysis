Alter LDAP configuration	"Hi.



NTE is currently in the process of restructuring their Active Directory catalogue.

Problems were encountered with Iteraplan during this operation, as moving the user account used for AD lookups/authentication effectively disabled Iteraplan logins using AD accounts.



Could you please inform us on how to alter the configuration ?



Thank you."		Technical question	iteraplan Support	27/Mar/17 10:01 AM	03/Apr/17 7:38 AM														"28/Mar/17 8:03 AM;cst;Dear M. Lukassen,

thank you inquiry.

The settings for the LDAP configuration can be changed in data ""iteraplan-auth.properties"".
You find the file in the path

""TOMCAT\WEBAPPS\ITERAPLAN\WEB-INF\classes\*"".

Greetings,
