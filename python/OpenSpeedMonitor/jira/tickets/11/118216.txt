Interfaces in InformationSystemViews (List and Single) are not updated properly	"Go to the List view of Interfaces 



Create a new Interface, keep one of the IS in mind



Go to the List View of Information Sytem



Go to the single element view of the IS you kept in mind.



Then the connected Interface is not shown yet. The same is happens when deleting an Interface. When the InfoFlows are shown in the list the same happenes here. When reloading the page in the list view the problem in the single element view is also solved.



Expected Behaviour: The views are updated properly.
