Deleting all business objects of one information flow causes errors	"1. case

 * Go to the information system list and click on the SEV of Account Sys RB # 3.1

 * delete all business objects of the interface TX Clearing

 * click on TX Clearing without refresh

 * Currently: The Name of TX Clearing does not contain information about the 2 connected information systems in the title as expected. If you now click on ""Back To List"" you get an error



2. case

 * Go to the interface list and delete all business objects of an interface

 * click on that interface to get to the SEV

 * the same error occurs, again, due to the fact that the 2 connected information systems cannot be found if the information flow is a dummy flow"		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	25/Apr/17 2:56 PM	05/May/17 4:27 PM
