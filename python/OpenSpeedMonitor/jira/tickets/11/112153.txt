Permission handling for attribute Groups (server + client)	"Similar to IPTS-313



*Summary:*

* Ensure the user has the permission ""Configure attribute groups"" to use /api/atg and /api/atg/id

* Permission ""configAttributeGroups"" (No. 3 on https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=94798389 )

* Server: Extend REST-API /api/administration/permissions with new entry in the JSON:



{code:java}

{""configAttributeGroups"" : true/false}

{code}



* Client:

** On initial load of the New Client, check this permission

** If this permission is false, hide the tile for the attribute group

** if the attribute Group is directly loaded from the url, display the permission warning {{GENERAL_PERMISSIONS_WARNING}}"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	17/Feb/17 4:19 PM	23/Mar/17 1:39 PM														14/Mar/17 10:17 AM;roia;I've tested in browser and reviewed the Javascript code. Someone has just to review the Java code.	"17/Mar/17 9:39 AM;roia;The approach of the permissions handling does not work well with routes which have dynamic parameters, like /:id.



User does not have permissions to attributes, but can access individual attribute page

Prohibit changing attribute group in the Single Attribute page in this case.
