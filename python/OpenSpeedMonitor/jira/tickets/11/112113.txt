Login information on login page configurable (server + client)	"As iteraplan administrator, I want to be able to configure, using the iteraplan UI, whether a login hint is to be displayed on the login page, and what information to display. The information is always a static text without formatting, always formatted in bold by us. Display below the login box, centered.



As iteraplan developer, I want to be able to set this information during the build process, so it can be automatically set for the public demo instance, for example.



Basic usecase: displaying a username and password for a demo-user. Or displaying information about a planned system downtime.



Implementation by saving the according information in the database and providing it to the client via REST. Also provide a property file key to set the information. The property key (if set) always overrides the setting via Administration->System."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	17/Feb/17 10:42 AM
