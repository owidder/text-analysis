Change from classic client to interactive client problem with IE 11 / 10	"Reproduce with a fresh installation of iteraplan (trunk)



# Start the tomcat server

# Open iteraplan

# Change in the tab ""ADMINISTRATION""

# Click on ""SHOW IN CLASSIC CLIENT"" 

# When the classic client was loaded, click on ""Administration"" and ""Configuration""

# The login screen opens from the interactive client 



It is only on the first change from classic to interactiv, after that the transfer is ok. 



Expected: No login when the user changes from classic to interactive

Actual: In the IE a login screen appears by the change from classic to interactive"		Bug	iteraplan PO	04/Feb/17 10:11 AM	09/Feb/17 9:59 AM														04/Feb/17 11:32 AM;cst;The problem also appeared on the LDAP installation 	07/Feb/17 1:44 PM;mada;Doesn't reproduce on trunk, 26763 revision	"08/Feb/17 12:47 PM;cst;It is still reproducible on this machine with the actual trunk.
