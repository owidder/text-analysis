Lite-Edition: New Client does not work in the lite-bundle	"*Summary:*

New Client does not work in the lite-bundle



*Reproduce:*

* Create a lite-bundle (ant-job or jenkins)

* Start the tomcat



*Actual:*

* The new client is not loaded but a exception is thrown (500 - for api/administration/generalInformation) (see screenshot)

* The classic client works correctly



*Expected:*

* The new client is loaded without exceptions



*First idea:*

* Maybe a missing permission for the liteuser (=mainuser)?"		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	02/Feb/17 10:28 AM	10/Feb/17 11:31 AM														10/Feb/17 11:32 AM;mse;Commit 26786 also belongs here!
