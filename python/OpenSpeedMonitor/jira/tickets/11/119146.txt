Weird reordering of enum attribute values	"*Steps to reproduce:*



Go to Administration - Attributes and open a page for some enumeration attribute with large list of values. In example, Manufacturer.



Drag the first item (Apache) to the bottom of the list.



*Expected result*: ""Apache"" is at the bottom, the order of the rest of elements remains unchanged.



*Actual result:* the item, which is at the position where you drag to jumps to the position of a dragged item: (the ""Iteratec GmbH"" will become the first one).

So, to achieve the desired result you have to reorder that ""jumped"" element, get another one jumped, that drives you mad and you smash your monitor with a keyboard, especially when you have lots of items in the list.
