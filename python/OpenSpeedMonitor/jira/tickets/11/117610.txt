Delete of selfrelations	"Go to SingleElementViwe of Funds txs # r12



Add ""Funds tx"" in the field for adding relations.



Funds tx # r13 is shown once



Delete the successor Funds tx # r13



Add ""Funds tx"" in the field for adding relations.



Expected: Funds tx # r13 is shown once



Current: Funds tx # r13 is shown twice, one of them adds the just the deleted relation, the other one is working correctly



Probably the delete function is not working correctly in this case"		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	04/Apr/17 9:22 AM	10/Apr/17 12:21 PM
