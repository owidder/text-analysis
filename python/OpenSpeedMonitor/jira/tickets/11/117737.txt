Deletion of Attribute and Reaction get in each other's way	"A metamodel change (observed with an deletion of an attribute) and a running Reaction can get in each other's way. The reaction might see different/inconsistentÂ states of the metamodel, which might lead to an exception.



Please prohibit this. A solution might be, that every metamodel change has to finish before some reaction starts running and vice versa.



Please contact [~cst] for the database and the script to reproduce the problem. Please also check, if there are any other metamodel changes which could lead to potential problems for reactions."
