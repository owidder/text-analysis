Performance improvement on adding/removing columns, step 2	"Calling ""api.setColumnDefs"" seems to be expensive. In step 1 of this ticket, one of those calls was removed.

Here, find a way, if feasible, to remove or reduce the ""setColumnDefs"" in IpListController.addColumn and IpListController.deleteColumn.

Ideas:

* Use visibility setting from ag-grid's columnAPI

* On adding a column the first time, do the current adding process.

* On removing a column, only make it invisible

* On adding a previously added column, just make it visible again"		Improvement	iteraplan PO	14/Feb/17 2:32 PM															"05/Jul/17 11:20 AM;roia;""api.setColumnDefs"" does not seemÂ very expensive to me. Refactoring using visibility seems dangerous too - we should take the hidden column into account in many places: do not store them in configuration and URL, do not take into account in quickfilter, etc. Showing hidden column will add it not at the end of grid, but at the position when they have been hidden and so on.



I let somebody else work on this, if he finds this refactoring useful."
