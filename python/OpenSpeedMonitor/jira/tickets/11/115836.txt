"	"22/Mar/17 3:28 PM;cst;Dear Mr. Siebel,

thank your for your inquiry. 

Could please do following steps:
 * Open the tab ""Administration"" and ""Configuration""
 * Click on ""Clear cache""
 * After the cache was cleared retry to add or delete a business mapping

In addition, our developers check the reason for this behavior and I will inform you when I have new information.

Greetings,

Is it needed @admin level?	"22/Mar/17 3:53 PM;cst;You need the permission ""Edit configuration of iteraplan"" then the menu ""Administration"" and ""Configuration"" appears.

thank you for your reply. 

Could you please execute the following command in your MS SQL Database:



*ALTER TABLE HISTORY_BM ALTER COLUMN IDENTIFIER_BB VARCHAR (1050) NULL;* 

When this was succeeded, restart the iteraplan instance and retry the progress.
