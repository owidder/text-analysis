Information Flow Diagram - docking points for edges	"With new client Information Flow diagram you have only one docking point vertically (right and left) and horizontally (top and bottom) of the IS rectangle.



if you have many flows to one central IS you need many docking points, you need to enlarge the rectangle of the IS, ...

which is currently not possible.



Otherwise the diagram is unclear and not readable."		Fault	iteraplan Support	05/Apr/17 2:49 PM	25/Apr/17 7:00 AM														"05/Apr/17 2:49 PM;ansgar.marsiske@coface.com;
