Information Flow Diagram: edge	"With classic view it was possible to show a description on the edge line. It is missing in new client.



Also not possible is to choose the edge line type depending on the attribute. It is possible to choose the attribute but not the line type per attribute.

It should be configurable - the best is at the level of the attribute definition like colors for IS attributes.



And probably it could be overwritten by diagram (as it is today for IS colors)"		Fault	iteraplan Support	05/Apr/17 2:40 PM	25/Apr/17 7:00 AM														"06/Apr/17 9:53 AM;cst;Hello, 

thank you for your inquiry. 

You can find all changes on the following side:

[https://doc.iteraplan.de/display/iteraplan55/Visualizations]

Not all features will be availible in the new diagram. 

For your usecase, you can check the Graphics Reaction Script ""[{{CorporateInfoFlow.zip}}|http://iteraplan.iteratec.de:8080/iteraplan-devel/client/resources/CorporateInfoFlow.zip]"".
Open the ""Information Flow Diagram"" and click on the link ""Show Customizable Information Flow"".

thank you for your answer.

why you omit such important feature as line type and caption? 
We use it very often to illustrate the type of an interface (by line type) and the business object transmitted (caption).

So it will be a real loss if you omit these functionality.

thanks for your reply. 

I have sended your feedback to our product managment.
 The roadmap for the year 2017 has no plan for this feature. 

For the Information Flow Diagram we have many new different requirements. Simultaneously we have the Graphics Reactor in interaction with the Tool yED, for many Graph-orienting visualizations.
 Some of our customers use this feature for individuel evaluations very often. In our example ""CorprateInfoFlow.zip"" you will find a good base to use this feature.
