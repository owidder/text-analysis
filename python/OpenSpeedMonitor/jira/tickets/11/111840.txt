Refactorings and improvements for ipList component	"Possible refactorings and changes to improve the readibilty and maintainability of the ipList component code

 (discussed during or after the ipListComponent Overview meeting on 15 February, 2017):

 * Improve the way the column width is adjusted

 ** See fitColumnWidthsToGrid() and correctWidthOfLastColumn() in ipList-component.js as starting point. Check how many times these methods are called when grid is rendered. Try to avoid multiple calls of these methods.



 * Put all information needed by iteraplan and *not* by ag-grid into a ColumnInfo object instead of the column definition directly

 ** Compare configureColumn() in bbtListColumnConfigurator.js as starting point



 * Make RowDataBuilder less dependend of the actual list type



 * Don't re-set full row data or column defs too often but use other appropriate methods of the grid API where possible

 ** See addColumn() in ipList-component.js, for example



 * Check URI serialization of the list configuration

 ** Make sure no translation keys are serialized to URI

 ** Saved queries page has url like: [http://localhost:8080/client/#/savedQueries?loadedSQs=ALL&columns=fieldK%2FsharedP%2FwidthK%2F70P%2FpropertyTypeK%2FsavedQueryIsSharedB%2FfieldK%2FnameP%2FpropertyTypeK%2FstringP%2FsortK%2FascP%2FsortedAtK%2F0P%2FwidthK%2F210B%2FfieldK%2FdescriptionP%2FpropertyTypeK%2FrichtextP%2FwidthK%2F300B%2FfieldK%2FreportTypeTranslatedP%2FpropertyTypeK%2FstringP%2FwidthK%2F210B%2FfieldK%2FbbTypeP%2FpropertyTypeK%2FstringP%2FwidthK%2F990&featureName=%2FsavedQueries] - do we really need to store the propertyType values?



 * Move {{descriptionCellRenderer}}, {{nameCellRenderer}} from controller(s) to a renderer



 * More comments especially in long if-statements (e.g. in {{RowDataBuilder.prototype.getRowData()}})



 * Think about the action column and its special role

 * The {{IpListConfiguration}} takes lots of configuration parameters, like renderers, etc, and they're often omitted, when called from the classes, which inherit it. E.g. {{IpListConfiguration.call(this, $log, $location, $translate, <and here lots of parameters with undefined values>);}}. I suggest to move the parameters to some options-object so that it will not be necessary to pass {{undefineds}} to the constructor. E.g., move the settings to the {{activatedFeatures}} parameter."
