Create SVG diagrams out of saved configuration (Client)	Create a service which creates out of an existing saved query of diagram (=url parameters) a SVG-file which can be included in any html-page.		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	29/Mar/17 9:46 AM	03/May/17 5:30 PM														11/Apr/17 1:51 PM;dmkh;Probably some changes in GoJS and {{headerDownloadService}}.js (IPTS-667) can effect this ticket ({{headerDosnloadService.js can be (re)used for getting SVGs of different diagrams).}}	"14/Apr/17 12:29 PM;dmkh;SVG service for diagrams is almost implemented.

Some moments to clarify are left:Â 

 * Initially all SVGs are loaded with flag {{fullDownload = true}}, correct? (no limitations for all browsers for SVG element)

 * Masterplan diagram is loaded with full timespan or only with visible? (probably blocked with IPTS-763, visible timespan is not saved in URL)



Anyway, the main functionality is already committed, so this ticket is no longer blocking Dashboard epic."	03/May/17 1:24 PM;dmkh;For reviewer: some refactoring was made in IPTS-766 in code related to this ticket.	"03/May/17 5:30 PM;viol;Review is done.
