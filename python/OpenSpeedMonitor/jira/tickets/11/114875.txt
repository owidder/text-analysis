{quote}containing main info about errors

{quote}

so, for example, I get following response from the server, which contains the errors information:



{{""UPDATESFAILEDFOR"": [\{}}

 {{  ""ID"": 1,}}

 {{  ""ERRORS"": [\{}}

 {{    ""ERRORCODE:""17"",}}

 {{    ""ERRORMESSAGES"":""Building Block not found""}}

 {{  }]}}

 {{},}}

 \{   ""ID"": 2,

 {{  ""ERRORS"": [\{}}

 {{      ""ERRORCODE: ""8"",}}

 {{      ""ERRORMESSAGES"": ""Field value too long""}}

 {{    },}}

 {{    \{}}

 {{      ""ERRORCODE"": ""9"",}}

 {{      ""ERRORMESSAGES"": ""Some other error message""}}

 {{  }]}}

 {{},}}

 \{

 {{  ID: 3,}}

 {{  ""ERRORS"": [\{}}

 {{    ""ERRORCODE"": ""15"",}}

 {{    ""ERRORMESSAGES"": ""Numeric value out of bounds""}}

 {{  }]}}

 {{}]}}



*Question 1*: should be display errors in plain text format (e.g., in <textarea> or <pre> container), or in formatted HTML (e.g., in <table>).



*Question 2*: how exactly this should look, how to we group multiple error messages, which are related to one building block.



 



If we use HTML-formatted output, then we can merge cells, use table header (""Id"", ""Name"", ""Errors""),



If we use plain text, then we should use different format.



With HTML-formatted solution we may achieve more readable format for the user, but if he copies it to the plain-text application, like Notepad, it will become much less readable.



With plain-text solution we should perform text formatting by ourselves, the formatting possibilities are very limited, but when pasted to Notepad, will look almost the same (old-school-style) as in the popup dialog.



 



 "	"15/Mar/17 11:30 AM;mkt;*One question*: Will plain-text (in case of using HTML-formating) look like this, which you put here as an example?



*If so:* _(to be confirmed with Fabian and Marcel)_

 # Use HTML-formated view for user, not everyone wants to copy errors and user will have the possibility to see what went wrong without big effort :)

 # In this case, as you already said, we can merge cells and list all error messages, when there are more for one Building Block"	"30/Mar/17 3:25 PM;olal;{quote} * Select all successful (german: ""Alle erfolgreiche Elemente auswählen"")



 * Select all unsuccessful (german: ""Alle fehlgeschlagene Elemente auswählen""){quote}

What if user wants to select *all* checkboxes ? Does he need to press two buttons?"	"30/Mar/17 3:34 PM;olal;* 

{quote}default button weiß - shows the list with marked checkboxes * Select all successful (german: ""Alle erfolgreiche Elemente auswählen"")

 * Select all unsuccessful (german: ""Alle fehlgeschlagene Elemente auswählen""){quote}

 * 

{quote}Action-Button violet Continue (german: ""Weiter"") (with checkboxes marked as for the first action){quote}So if I understood correct, user need to press the button foe showing the list, after press the one of buttons to select some checkboxes, and then press 'continue'. I think it's has a low usability. And what if user wants to press 'continue' immediately?"	"24/Apr/17 1:51 PM;roia;[~mkt], how should the [ALL UNSUCCESSFUL] button work in case there're no failed records?



!all_updated.jpg!"	"24/Apr/17 3:39 PM;roia;[~olal], I'd try to combine  $scope.selectSuccessful and $scope.selectFailed into one function, because there's only one word of difference in them.



Also, there's one review comment. https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-489#CFR-42953



--------------------------------------------



I see potential performance bottlenecks in this task if we have large amount of data in ag-grid, because there're few places in the code, which loop through all grid nodes, like:



{{$scope.api.forEachNode(function(node)\{}}

 \{\{ if($scope.data.failed.elements.find(function(element)\{}}



[~msr], is the performance critical for this task? If not, we can leave current implementation as is, if it is, we should, probably, test on large amount of data and, if necessary, make some optimization.
