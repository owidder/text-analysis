Adding of business objects in List-View of interfaces shows empty field in editor	"* Go to the List View of Interfaces

 * Add the column ""Information Flows""

 * Delete the all bussiness objects of an interface

 * Refresh

 * Edit the business objects by adding one

 * 1: in the editor you do not only see the new added business object but also an empty field which is deletable (see attached picture 1). if you delete the empty field and apply, the new business object is still written in the 2nd line of the cell.

 2: if you now edit again, delete the empty field again and apply, the business object is grayed as seen attached on picture 2"		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	25/Apr/17 9:45 AM	09/May/17 9:28 AM														02/May/17 5:10 PM;pma;for the reviewer: filtering is a fast solution here because "params" were probably manipulated in the library class "renderedCell"	"03/May/17 10:27 AM;aan;Without simplifying the loop the size of the row is smaller after adding an new element in the cell that was empty before, so maybe revert the last change?
