!no_apply_cancel.jpg|thumbnail!



 I think, would be better when buttons are always visible at the bottom of the window and only filter conditions part is scrollable. [~mkt], [~msr], what do you think?"	27/Apr/17 1:43 PM;roia;[~vadm], please update the documentation https://doc.iteraplan.de/display/iteraplan60/Filtering	27/Apr/17 1:47 PM;msr;I fully agree with your suggestion, [~roia]. Please implement it like that.	"27/Apr/17 1:55 PM;roia;Empty filters are displayed in the legend, which is different than in old implementation. [~msr], should we fix this, or leave as it is?



!empty-filters.jpg|thumbnail!"	27/Apr/17 2:36 PM;msr;Good, that you saw it. Please fix it.	"27/Apr/17 2:39 PM;roia;Review: [https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-541]



 "	"28/Apr/17 3:28 PM;roia;[~msr], how the unfinished filters should be handled and displayed in the legend (see below)?



!unfinished_filters.jpg|width=1124,height=371!"	"28/Apr/17 4:41 PM;msr;Thanks for double-checking.

I don't see any reason to change the behaviour of unfinished filters compared to the functionality of iteraplan 5.5. In 5.5 the filters started to be shown in the legend as soon as an operator appeared. Can we implement it similiarly?"
