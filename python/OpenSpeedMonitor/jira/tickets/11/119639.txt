Visible timespan download is not working	"When downloading MPD diagram with specific timespan, it is ignored and full timespan is loaded.

Also full download is working incorrectly (timespan table is empty).



*Expected result*: only visible timespan is used for diagram download, the same is for full download."		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	26/Apr/17 4:57 PM	04/May/17 12:11 PM														04/May/17 12:11 PM;viol;Review is done. No any comments
