List Create / List Edit - No function for the button (X) for the date interval (IE11)	"Reproduce with trunk or nightly in the IE 11



# Open the list view for ""Information Systems""

# Add the column ""Productive period""

#Click on the button ""Create Element""

# Choose the ""Productive period"" and click on the edit symbol

# The edit dialog opens ""

# Click on the button (X) 

# Nothing happens 



After many clicks the dialog will be closed or not



Expected: The edit dialog closes on one click

Actual: The edit dialog will be closed after many times clicking the (X) or it happens nothing



The same problem is on the list edit and the column type ""date interval""



*Update*: in IE-10 there's no edit symbol at all :(



Regarding IE-11:

There's a problem in IE with creation of event in ipDateIntervalEditor-component.js

The solution is to implement ""reset"" the same way as ""applyChange"" is implemented (see the code above in the same file).

The other possible solution is to use  IE polyfill for the CustomEvent constructor at MDN: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/26596123/internet-explorer-9-10-11-event-constructor-doesnt-work"		Bug	iteraplan PO	01/Feb/17 9:52 AM	03/Feb/17 3:05 PM														"03/Feb/17 3:05 PM;dmkh;??Update: in IE-10 there's no edit symbol at all??

There is a separate bug-ticket for this: IPTS-532



Review is done, bug is fixed"
