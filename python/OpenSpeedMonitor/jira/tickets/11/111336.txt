Disfunctional login page on logout when using SSO configuration	"_Reproduce:_

# Access iteraplan on http://sql-iteraplan.iteratec.de/iteraplanSSO (or another instance using SSO)

# Switch to interactive client (if not already there)

# Log out



_Expected:_ User is automatically logged in again

_Actual:_ Login page is shown



The issue seems to be that there is no request done that triggers the windows authentication of the IIS webserver.
