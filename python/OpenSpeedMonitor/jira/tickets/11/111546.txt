Migration of list shows "missing attribute" error by mistake	"Reproduce:



* Migrate query id: 108 ""AWSe und ihre AWSKs (aktive + freeze Systeme)"" from TESTDATA3 database

* Open in new client



Expected:

* IS list is loaded with correctly migrated settings



Actual:

* ""Missing attribute"" error (see screenshot)

When the same query is loaded again in the new client (so after automatic fix of URL), everything works fine and the results in new and old client are identical"		Bug	iteraplan PO	10/Feb/17 1:59 PM	13/Feb/17 9:35 AM
