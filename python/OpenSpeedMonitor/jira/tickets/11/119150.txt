Rest requests to server without active license cause unexpected responses.	"When server has no active license uploaded and receives rest request with authorization header (i.e. from external applications) - it causes null pointer exceptions on server side and client gets unexpected responses with 500 Status code.



Steps to reproduce:

1. Have server with no active license (user gets provide license dialog window while logging to application)

2. Send rest request to any endpoint with Authorization header (i.e. /api/data)

3. Request processing on server-side fails with null pointer exception and server responds with 500 Status code.
