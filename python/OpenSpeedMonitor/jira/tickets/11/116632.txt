 * 'Show in diagram: {color:#14892c}[dropdown list 1]{color}, as {color:#59afe1}[dropdown list 2]{color}' (german: Im Diagramm [dropdown list 1], als [dropdown list 2] zeigen)

 * in {color:#14892c}dropdown list 1{color} there should be list of all diagrams (9) - with translations for german version:

 ## Landscape Diagram

 ## Nested Cluster

 ## Information Flow

 ## Masterplan Diagram

 ## Portfolio Diragram

 ## Cluster Diagram

 ## Pie Chart Diagram

 ## Bar Chart Diagram

 ## Tree Map Diagram

When both chosen, open a diagram with the type set as selected and an active filter for name is yyyy, so that only the element from the single view is shown.
