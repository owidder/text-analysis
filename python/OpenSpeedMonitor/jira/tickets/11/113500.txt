Documentation not found	"Hello Support,



I'm looking for the ""Installation Prerequisites"" documents on your homapage. I should upgrade our Iteraplan instance from Version 5.2 to 5.5. I have an upgrade guide as PDF but now I'm looking for the system requirements (Tomcat version, Java, database)

On your Homepage I get the HTTP Response 404 (page not found). The link is part of the upgrade guide.



How can I Access These documents?



Regards Matthias

it was the wrong document, because we are on 5.2 so we need only the requirements of 5.3 to 5.5. But I got the documents from your website now.
You can close the ticket.
