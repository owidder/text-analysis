 [~msr], there is also separate functional *permission for viewing Dashboard*. Should it also be implemented ""side-by-side"" to *{{useDiagrams}}* permission?

  "	"12/Apr/17 12:06 PM;fka;[~dmkh]: The funtional permission for viewing Dashboards was never used for the custom Dashboard, but for something else. Besides, it will be dropped with the next release. So: useDiagrams functional permission only.
