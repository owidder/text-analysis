Log Level	"Hi



Is there a way to re-configure the Log Level of the general log like for Javascript & Ajax?

https://doc.iteraplan.de/display/iteraplan55/Increase+log+level



My interest is to change e.g. 

log4j.logger.org.springframework=DEBUG

without a restart of the Tomcat.



Thanks Martin"		Technical question	iteraplan Support	27/Mar/17 1:18 PM	05/Apr/17 1:53 PM														"27/Mar/17 1:28 PM;cst;Hello Martin,

it is possible to open the tomcat manager stop the iteraplan instance, change the loglevel of iteraplan and restart the iteraplan instance. 
At this moment the changed settings will be used. 

For this change is no restart of the tomcat server necessary.
