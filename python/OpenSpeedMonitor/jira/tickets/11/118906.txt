Attribute - Building Block Types view not correct after "cancel"	"Reproduce with trunk

 # Open ""Administration"" and ""Attributes""

 # Open the attribute ""Accountability""

 # Click on the edit symbol for ""Activated for the following Building Blick Types:""

 # Click on the X for ""Technical Component"" 

 # The ""Do you really want to delete?"" dialog appears

 # We click on ""CANCEL""

 # The ""Technical Component"" dissapered from the list 

 # On reload the page the ""Technical Component"" appears again in the list



You can add after ""CANCEL"" the ""Technical Component"" again and thats can crash the software 



Expected: After click on ""CANCEL"" everything stays the same

Actual: The ""CANCEL"" button has a strange side effect "		Bug	iteraplan PO	18/Apr/17 9:39 AM	21/Apr/17 4:09 PM
