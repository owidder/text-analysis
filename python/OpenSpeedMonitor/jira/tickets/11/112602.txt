After upgrade to 5.5 blank screen	"Dear Support, after the upgrade, the user is experimenting some problem to access. 

When I've login to the instance, it takes so much time to load.



After loading the page is in blank and in top bar appears TO_CLASSIC_CLIENT and three buttons.



Is that normal?



I'm waiting for more feedback from the user and will keep in touch with you."		Technical question	iteraplan Support	22/Feb/17 9:06 AM	27/Feb/17 10:39 AM														"22/Feb/17 9:48 AM;cst;Dear Sir / Madam,

thank you for your enquiry.

Would you please give me Name of our customer and the following LOG-Files so we can check the problem.
From the conf-directory of your Tomcat-Installation:

server.xml
web.xml

The “catalina.out” and “localhost.log” files from your tomcat installation (just for the period, when the error occurred).

From [Tomcat]/webapps/[iteraplan directory]/WEB-INF/classes:

log4j.properties

From [Tomcat]/webapps/[iteraplan directory]/META-INF:

context.xml (This file can contain passwords -> please remove the passwords)*

The iteraplan log files from the period, when the error occurred. The files are called “iteraplan-[version].log” (for today) or „iteraplan-[version].log.[TIMESTAMP]” (for past days). The location of these file was specified during installation and is documented in the file “log4j.properties”.
