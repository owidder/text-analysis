Oracle JRE - license check	"Hello Support,



At a maintenance check of our infrastructure, we found a topic, where we need some input.



Oracle Java (1.7 and higher) has features includes, at the moment we use it, we need a separate license for it. Because of your system requirements, we must use Oracle JRE.



So can you comment the question, if you use one of the features, the customer has to license?

iteraplan only uses the freely available features of the Oracle JRE. No features listed in the table 1-1 are needed.

So no Oracle JRE license is required for running iteraplan.

Best regards
Fabian Kainzinger"	"28/Apr/17 12:11 PM;matthias.roth@dekra.com;Hello Mr Kainzinger,
