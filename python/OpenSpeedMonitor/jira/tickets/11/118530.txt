Datamodel is not correctly updated	"Reproduce:



Go to the List view of Interfaces and change the assigned Information Systems for one of the Interfaces.



Keep in mind what interface this is.



Go to the Information System that is newly assigned to this Interface



Expected: The new interface is shown



Current behaviour: The interface is not shown (and is also not in the datamodel)
