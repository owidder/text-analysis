Uniqunes constraint fails on Value Name - Enumeration Attribute (server)	"Reproduce with trunk

 # Open ""Administration"" and ""Attributes""

 # Open the attribute ""CRUD""

 # Edit the name of the ""Nr. - 1"" into ""E and press Enter

 # A error message appears and the name is setted to ""E"" 

 # We have now two ""E""´s in the database and after restart the tomcat server the iteraplan instance cannot be started. 

 # After changing the attribute value from ""Nr. - 1"" in the database into ""C"" the software starts again



Expected: That the value which is illegal will not be saved in the database

 Actual: The value which is illegal (uniqunes constraint) will be saved in the database "		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	15/Mar/17 10:50 AM	24/Apr/17 1:23 PM
