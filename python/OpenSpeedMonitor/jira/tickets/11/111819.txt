Saved Query Migration: No timestamp in query name 	"Currently in the Saved Query Migration the system timestamp will be added to the name of the query in the new client.



Please remove this timestamp, and add ' (2)', ' (3)' etc. whenever necessary. Don't add ' (1)', of course. It is important, that the query name is unchanged if there is no query by that name in the new client."
