Migration of Saved Queries: Fix Exact/Strict-Switch	"*As-Is:*

* The exact/strict-setting of the classic client is migrated *in any case* to the new client setting



*To-Be:*

* If there is a Business Mapping configuration (i.e. axis and content together are part of a Business Mapping) without any hierarchy level filter The exact/strict-setting of the classic client is still migrated to the new client setting

* In any other case, the exact/strict-setting of the classic client can not be migrated, i.e. show a log message"		Bug	iteraplan PO	06/Feb/17 9:29 AM	09/Feb/17 8:09 AM
