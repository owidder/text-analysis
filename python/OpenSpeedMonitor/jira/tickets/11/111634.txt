Missing single enum filter when loading filter from URL in list view	"_Reproduce:_

# Go to IS list

# Configure a filter:

{noformat}

   ""Complexity"" contains ""av""

OR ""Complexity"" is ""low""

{noformat}

# Apply and close filter dialog

# Reload the page with F5



_Expected:_ The same filter

_Actual:_ The ""contains"" single filter is missing



Addition: This also seems to happen with the ""no value"" operator."		Bug	iteraplan PO	13/Feb/17 10:58 AM	13/Feb/17 1:34 PM														13/Feb/17 1:34 PM;dmkh;Fixed by [~mada] in revision *5977*
