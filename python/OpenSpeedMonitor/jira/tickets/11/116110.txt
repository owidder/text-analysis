TBD: grid data resorted atfer column is removed	"To reproduce: 

 # Sort list of building blocks by some column

 # Remove this column



Result - the data in grid gets resorted by first visible column.



I think, this could be confusing, especially when mass update mode is on and there're rows selected."
