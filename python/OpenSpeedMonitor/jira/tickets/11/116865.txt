Use the GoJS zooming feature.

 The zoom-level calculation should be implemented like in the Cluster Diagram:

 have constants for min, max ans step (let's currently use MIN: 5, MAX: 300, STEP: 5)

 and override the scaling calculation

 Zoom level should be displayed in the legend if it's not = 100% 

 Zoom level should be saved in URL/configuration if it is set by user."	07/Jun/17 10:12 AM;aan;Also some adaptions are made in th documentation
