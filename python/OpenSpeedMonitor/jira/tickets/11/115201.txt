5.5 Filtering	"Hi



We use a lot the filtering on an attribute list-values. Now, in the docu I found a statement, that this functionality does not exist anymore in the new version 5.5.

https://doc.iteraplan.de/display/iteraplan55/Filter 



What can we do, to get this function back? Usability is much better to select a pre-defined value, rather than typing freetext.

thank you for your inquiry.

Do you mean the Dropdown suggestion, or a other Filter statement?

thank you for your reply. 

At the moment there are no plans to insert this Text-Filter back in Version 6.0.
 For your use case you can create a ""Enum Attribute"" and filter with the created values of the attribute.

So the new version of the ui will break my use case… 

if you want a list of all ""Name is ..."" in the interactive you can use the ""Manuel Selection"" filter.
 # Open the list view 
 # Open ""Edit Filter"" 
 # Change to the ""Manuel Selection"" 
 # Here are all Names of e.g. Information Systems  

In the ""Manuel Selection"" filter you can search for ""Names"" too. 
Additional when you set a filter like ""Name starts with S"" the ""Manuel Selection"" filter will be updated and shows only the Information Systems with ""S"" on the begining. 

Greetings,
