I think, it would be better to implement one, which would contain some more information.



E.g. also include in the userProfile response the data, which is currently retrieved with permissionsService (user profile would also contain permissions data and other user-related data). (/)"	06/Mar/17 8:42 AM;msr;I think, that's ok. Let's include it there. I'll update the ticket description.	"16/Mar/17 10:31 AM;dmkh;??Replace existing logout-button with icon ""account circle"" and the name of the user??

 [~msr], name of the user is login name or FirstName + LastName?



Also, I placed {{userProfile}} to {{headerScope}}, so it is accessible in all controllers using {{headerScope}}."	"20/Mar/17 2:22 PM;msr;It is the login name.

Good idea with the headerScope."
