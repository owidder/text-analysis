Attribute Groups - honrizontal scrollbar on the bottom of the page	"Reproduce with trunk and big data



When you have a attribute group with more then 30 attributes you must scroll down (vertically) to use the horinzontalÂ scrollbar.



The scrollbar is on the bottom of page and not on the bottom of the screen.



Please fix."		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	19/Apr/17 2:49 PM	04/May/17 11:00 AM
