*Not really connected, but please clearify:*

For a binding set or synthetic query like

{{InformationSystem[@typeOfStatus!=""Current""]/projects;}}

the result lists are sorted by name *and* description.



I think, sorting by name should be enough and this is just a copy&paste error in ""queryConsole-tupleConfiguration.js"" where the default columns are defined.
