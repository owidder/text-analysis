NULL values in tables ATG, ATTR, AVG_ENUM or UE prohibit login	"In version 5.5 you can not login when in one of the tables/columns at least one NULL value is present:



ATG, ATTR, UE: Either the column ""LAST_MOD_USER"" or ""LAST_MOD_TIME""

 AVG_ENUM: DEF_COLOR



Reproduce:

 # Set a NULL value in one the columns in one of the tables

 # After that the login stops working



Expected: login works

 Actually: no login possible



Resolution:

 No (big) change in the application, see below. Only provide a DB level fix script. We will send this script to customers who report this problem.

 Also include this script as a general DB update script for the 6.0 release. The script should therefore only change DB entries which have this problem. Replace NULL values with some static value, the color might be black.



Additional:

 This ticket requires changes in the application code. The property IteraplanProperties.PROP_LASTMODIFICATION_LOGGING_ENABLED and its usages should be removed."		Bug	iteraplan Thunderduck	23/Feb/17 2:25 PM	02/May/17 10:50 AM
