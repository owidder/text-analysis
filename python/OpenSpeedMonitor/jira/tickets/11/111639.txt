List view shows "undefined" as cell content	"Reproduce:



# Go to list view

# Add many columns so that a horizontal scrollbar appears

# Add few more columns without scrolling to them!

# After enough columns have been added, scroll to the las columns



Expected:

* All columns are there and are filled properly



Actual:

* The first row contains ""undefined"" values for the columns that were not visible before (see screenshot)"		Bug	iteraplan PO	13/Feb/17 11:36 AM	14/Feb/17 9:04 AM														"13/Feb/17 11:42 AM;sfe;This ""undefined"" issue also happens in this case:

# Create some filter in list view

# deselect all elements in ""manual selection""

# save the view under some name

# load the saved query

# open filter and add some or all of the elements in ""manual selection""



=> first line in the list shows ""undefined"" everywhere."
