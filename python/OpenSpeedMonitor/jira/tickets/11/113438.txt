 "	17/Mar/17 9:54 AM;olal; I've tried to implement it yesterday but there is a big problems with markup so i didn't manage with it. !image-2017-03-17-10-51-53-478.png!!image-2017-03-17-10-53-59-380.png!	20/Mar/17 9:30 AM;mkt;Wouldn't it be easier, if clicking the button activated new column on the left side and on top (in header) there would be another checkbox allowing the user to select all ?	20/Mar/17 11:14 AM;roia;[~mkt], no it's not easier, because we will have to implement that by ourselves. The easier solution is to use the feature, which is already implemented in ag-grid: https://www.ag-grid.com/javascript-grid-selection/#gsc.tab=0	"22/Mar/17 2:37 PM;roia;[~mkt], [~msr]
