Error when reading LSD from URI	"_Reproduce:_

# Go to LSD in interactive client

# Configure x-axis (columns) to display an arbitrary attribute like Complexity

# Configure a filter for y-axis (rows) like {{Accountability - arbitrary value}}

# Close filter dialog

# Reload page (F5)



_Expected:_ Same diagram as configured above after reload.

_Actual:_ Error because of an attempt to read an xAxisFilter from URI when there is none."		Bug	iteraplan PO	16/Feb/17 10:07 AM	16/Feb/17 2:04 PM
