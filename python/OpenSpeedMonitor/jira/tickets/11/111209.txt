CCD: Header: Numeric range calculation does not work together with numeric filter

Please adapt the numeric range calculation in the header.



*Reproduce:*

* Open the default CCD

* Set Costs in the header and Projects in the rows

* Filter the header by ""Costs between 0 to 100""



*Actual:*

* Still all projects are shown because the columns/ranges in the header are recalculated and all projects with big costs are shown in the column "">=50""



*Expected:*

* The projects with costs > 100 are not shown



*Solution:*

* Re-implement the ranges-algorithm which creates the column headers:

** The intial implementation is ok

** If a numeric filter is active in the header, do explictely ignore this range and do not show it in the header"		Bug	iteraplan PO	07/Feb/17 4:02 PM	13/Feb/17 11:43 AM														13/Feb/17 11:43 AM;dmkh;Review is done
