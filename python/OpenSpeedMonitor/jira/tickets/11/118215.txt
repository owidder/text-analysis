When you click on the button ""Back to List"" the ""Attribute"" will created corrupt and the list view of the Attributes is broken too. After restart the tomcat server no login is possible. 



Expected: That you can create ""Enumeration"" attribute

 Actual: The save of an ""Enumeration"" attribute crashes the software



*Server:* check what data comes to server in the request, verify the data, do not save the data which can break everything, return the response with error status/message.



*Client:* fix exception(s), send correct data."		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	10/Apr/17 10:18 AM	08/Jun/17 4:21 PM
