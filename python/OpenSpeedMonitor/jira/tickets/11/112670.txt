Create the possibility to create a new role



*User Story:*

* On the role list page create a new button ""Create Element"" (like on the Building Block List)

* After clicking on the button the user gets redirected to the Single Role View with a fake-id

* Show an info-alert-message every time a new role is being created: ""Only for iTurm-installations: Roles are to be created and modified in the external application iTurm."" (GER: ""Nur für iTurm-Installationen: Rollen müssen in der externen Applikation iTurm angelegt und gepflegt werden."")

* The Name-field is already selected, so the user can start typing

* The Name-field is the only mandatory field which needs to be entered

* The rest of the fields can be edited by using the ""normal"" edit-features"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	22/Feb/17 5:56 PM	28/Mar/17 8:23 AM
