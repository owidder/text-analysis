Iteraplan license issue	"Hi.



The Iteraplan installation at NTE have suddenly begun complaining about the license, and noone are able to log in.



Upon logon, the following message is presented: ""Invalid or missing license. The license can be uploaded here [link to license key input page]"".

Further, when trying to activate the license the following error is given ""License update failed (invalid or expired).""



I've double checked the license key, which was sent to me by Olga Krieger.



What to do ?"		Fault	iteraplan Support	02/Apr/17 10:42 PM	22/Apr/17 7:00 AM														"03/Apr/17 7:41 AM;cst;Dear Mr. Lakassen,

thanks for your inquiry. 

Your current License-Key is the following: 

Tm9yZC1UcsO4bmRlbGFnIEVsZWt0cmlzaXRldHN2ZXJrIEFTIChOVEUpADaI4LjAyLjIwMTgAMzcwNzc4MkZDOTFERDc1MDk4NUQzRTc2NzJDMzczREU3N0I0NzM5NTcwM0VEMkYxRTVFQTY1NkYwNjk3MkQ0QQ==

Is the error the same? When yes, you can replace the key in the database table ""License"". After this the software has again a valid license.

I've tried inserting this one using the WEB UI, but it gives the same error message - ""License update failed (invalid or expired).""

The one currently present in the database is identical to the one Olga sent, but differs from the one you are referring to.

Can you please elaborate as to why this happens ? Is this normal behaviour ?

Thanks.

thank you for your reply. 

The key from my first post, is the license for NTW 2017. 
In our release mail for version 5.5 was this key was sended to your iteraplan release contact person.

When you want, I add you to the  iteraplan release contact persons of your company.

Is this key for version 5.5 only ?

To my knowledge, NTE's installation of Iteraplan has not been upgraded from 5.3. Or am I missing something here ?

Yes, please add me as a recipient for these kind of notifications.

Thanks.
Jorn."	"03/Apr/17 9:25 AM;jorn.lukassen@evry.com;Update: I've tried updating the 'license' table with the key you provided, and restarted the Tomcat service.

However, I still get the same error message:
""Invalid or missing license. The license can be uploaded here [link to license key input page]"".

Thanks.
Jorn."	"03/Apr/17 9:34 AM;cst;I checked the license and it works correcty. 

[^license.txt]

 ^Your license was successfully updated. Licensee: ""Nord-Trøndelag Elektrisitetsverk AS (NTE)"", valid through 02/28/2018 

Please check that no blanks are on the end of the string.

This last one worked. Great.

As you can see, there is a difference between the one you sent earlier today and the one from your last post (one character that has slipped in there somehow).

Now - is there any possibility that this will occur again in the future ?

Thanks.
Jorn."	"03/Apr/17 10:01 AM;cst;Hi Jorn,

thank you for your reply.

I will add you to the release mails, then have you the key 1 month before it expires.
You can add a new key over the interactive client - Administration and the tab ""System"".
