Fit column size if widths are not defined 	"- open some list view for a building block type

- reset view

- manipulatte the URL by removing width information for every column (we produce this case if we migrate old queries, because they dont contain any width information)

- refresh view

- columns should occupate the whole page and leave no spaces



- the column width algorithmus already exists. it should be runed in case of undefined widths too"		Bug	iteraplan PO	31/Jan/17 4:30 PM	03/Feb/17 1:12 PM
