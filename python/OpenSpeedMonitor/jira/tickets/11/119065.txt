Response of backend is not correct for one to many relations	"For changes of one-to-many relations the response from the server is not complete.



Example for parent-child:



Updates for the child and the new parent are shown, the change of the old parent is missing.



This also happens for generalisation-specialication that is also one-to-many



Reproduce:



Change the child by adding it as a child to a new parent (when changing the parent of the child itself the response is correct)
