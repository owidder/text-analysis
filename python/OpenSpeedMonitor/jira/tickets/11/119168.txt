Less updates for Elastic	"In this ticket just check the performance. If this is a good improvement, create an extra ticket for implementing the improvement.



 



Please check if this improves the performance first.



As the information about changes of BB is available in the when updating, only building blocks with real changes could be updated.



E.g. at the moment, also all business mappings are updated when a IS is changed even though the business mappings themselves did not change.



See TransactionBasedModelUpdater.persistInMemoryModel() around line 116 as starting point.



Compare also comments in --IPTT-130--



 



These changes now are available ModelChange object when updating the elastic model."
