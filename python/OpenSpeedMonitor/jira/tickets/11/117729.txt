Information Flow Diagram - layout arrangement	"Information Flow Diagram:

Modified layout (arrangement of the elements) is lost. Diagram is always rebuilt in the same arrangement (obviously based on an algorithm).



We intensively use information flow diagrams. when creating a new diagram we have to arrange the layout on the diagram and when we rebuild it we want to use this arranged layout again. in the past we use Visio and iteraplan shape we did it more or lee good.



I understand that Version 6 will add Visio export and something like the iteraplan shape?

Will there a ""layout memory"" in iteraplan itself ?"		Fault	iteraplan Support	05/Apr/17 12:01 PM	25/Apr/17 7:00 AM														"06/Apr/17 12:59 PM;cst;Hello,

thank you for your feedback. 

At the moment there are no plans for a ""layout memory"".
The Visio export will be done in one of the next releases.

Greetings,
