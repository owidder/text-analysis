Misbehaviour of Multivalue editor in Firefox	"case 1:

 # Open iteraplan in Firefox (version 53.0)

 # Open SEV of an informationsystem, e.g. ""Account-Sys RB # 3.1""

 # Edit business objects of an assigned interface, e.g. ""TX Clearing (Account-Sys RB # 3.1 - Monetary txs RB # 2.0)""

 # Click on the cross -> the browser moves to the bottom of the page, the editor is still open

 Hint: The browser moves to the bottom of the page too if the focus is moved to another window (on Windows 10)

 # Scroll to the editor, click on the cross -> the editor closes



case 2:

 # Open iteraplan in Firefox (version 53.0)

 # Open SEV of an informationsystem, e.g. ""Account-Sys RB # 3.1""

 # Edit business objects of an assigned interface, e.g. ""TX Clearing (Account-Sys RB # 3.1 - Monetary txs RB # 2.0)""

 # Select an itom from the selection list of available business objects -> the browser moves to the top of the page, then back to the editor

 Result: the editor is on the bottom end in the browser window, the open selection list hides some items
