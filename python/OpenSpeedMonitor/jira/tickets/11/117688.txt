Graphics Reactor: "Saved queries before" in the NC	"""Execute saved queries before"": Switch from old client queries to queries in the new client. Instead of a text field, present a multi select input field with all saved queries to the user. Be aware that the order of saved queries is relevant.



UseÂ IPTT-399 for generating the list of IDs.



No migration of currently configured saved queries necessary. So all configurations will have no configured saved queries after implementation of this ticket."		Epic	iteraplan Thunderduck	04/Apr/17 5:28 PM
