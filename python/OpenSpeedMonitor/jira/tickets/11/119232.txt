Mass Update - Single Enumeration - Empty set 	"Reproduce with trunk

 # Open ""Data"" and ""Information Systems""

 # Add the column ""Service Provider""

 # Let the value field empty and click on ""Set""

 # In the summary 7 updates failed



Expected: That the click on ""Set"" will clean the column ""Accountability"", as a click on clear would do

 Actual: A empty ""Set"" cannot be executed"		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	21/Apr/17 2:04 PM	27/Apr/17 12:11 PM														27/Apr/17 12:11 PM;vadm;Review is doneÂ https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/fisheye/cru/IP-536
