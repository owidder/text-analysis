upgrade process	"Hello Support team,



we are going to upgrade our instance of iteraplan form version 5.2 to 5.5.

I could only find documents to upgrade from 5.3 to  5.4 and 5.4 to 5.5.



But for 5.3, I got only an installation guide. Is there an upgrade guide from 5.2 to 5.3?



Regards Matthias"		Technical question	iteraplan Support	24/Feb/17 3:51 PM	27/Feb/17 9:34 AM														"27/Feb/17 7:47 AM;cst;Good Morning Matthias,

Can you check it again.
