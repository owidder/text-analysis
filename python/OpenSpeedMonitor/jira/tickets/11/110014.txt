Handle required attributes as "real" required	"Dear support, 



at the moment it is possible to save an element of an building block even if it has an attribute which is marked as required. The only indicator is a red mark of the field. 

Do you know if there's an workaround or setting where we can define that the element can only be saved if the required field is filled?



Thanks in advance, 

Best regards, 

Benedikt Schmaler"		Technical question	iteraplan Support	30/Jan/17 9:59 AM	19/Feb/17 7:00 AM														"30/Jan/17 11:34 AM;cst;Dear Mr. Schmaler,

thank you for your inquiry. 

When attributes have the checkbox ""Required"" activated, then a red mark appears on the creation of e.g. a new Information System. 
Its a information for the users that the information of the attribute field is required.  

It is not possible that e.g. Informations System will not be created,  when the ""Required"" attributes are empty. We have here no work a round, because its technical not implemented.

Greetings,
