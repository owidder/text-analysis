Server-Client Synchronisation via ETag (Server + Client)	"Server should save last 10 user-triggered changes with ETags persistently in a collection (but not in the database).



If a client sends a polling request with an outdated etag, the server sends all changesets since the time of the clients etag. But if the etag is older than the last 10 changes, the server sends a request to fully update the datamodel.
