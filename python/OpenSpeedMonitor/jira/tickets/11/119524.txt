Mass Update - Mass Subscribe dont work in IE 11 (and switched symbols)	"Reproduce with trunk, IE 11 and big data 

 # Open ""Architectural Domains""

 # Nothing happens 



Addittional in the IE 11 the symbols are switched in contrast to Chrome:



IE  !image-2017-04-25-13-34-18-849.png!  Chrome    !image-2017-04-25-13-35-26-673.png!



 

 Expected: That the symbols are the same and the function is working in the IE 11

 Actual: That the symbols are ordered in every browser the same and that Mass Subscribe works in IE 11"		Bug	iteraplan PO	25/Apr/17 1:37 PM	23/May/17 5:55 PM														23/May/17 5:55 PM;fka;Work with current nightly build
