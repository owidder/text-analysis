Make updateLicense-Page available on URL	"*Summary:*

Make updateLicense-Page available on URL without the full loading (all REST-requests) of the application.

This is needed for the SSO-configuration which has no login-page



{color:red}UPDATE:{color}

* Simple HTML-page with JavaScript and JQuery.

* Please use existing REST-endpoint from the login-UploadLicense as it has anonymous authentication.

* Successfull upload redirects to home screen

* Any unsuccessfull upload shows the following message: ""The License could not being activated""

* No localisation: everything in English

* Please update User Guide (https://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan55/License)



*UPD*

The html page is located at /client/license_upload.html"		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	01/Feb/17 9:19 AM	09/Feb/17 12:59 PM														"01/Feb/17 9:27 AM;roia;[~msr] Then we need separate HTML page for this. How the license upload should work? Should we use the current REST service or a separate endpoint?

How the errors should be handled? Should we use AJAX calls or reload the whole page, like it was in the old implementation?

Upon successful upload should we get redirected to an angular application or to some separate login page?"	"03/Feb/17 8:44 AM;msr;Results of the tests in the SSO-instance:



The html-page does not work with the built iteraplan as all used dependencies (like jQuery) are minified and combined.



Possible solution ideas:

* Either adapt the grunt-build to change the path of the dependencies in license_upload.html (preferrable?)

* Or use plain javascript without any dependencies :("	03/Feb/17 12:15 PM;roia;[~msr], [~sfe], I have updated the build task to use combined JS-file	06/Feb/17 3:27 PM;msr;@cst already tested it manually. Please do only code review in scope of this ticket.
