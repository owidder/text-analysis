No History after upgrade to 5.4	"After Upgrading from 5.3 to 5.4, even with adding ""history.enabled=true"" to iteraplan.properties, there's no ""History""-Tab available f.e. on the IS page.

Regarding the documentation, a ""Administration-System""-page is described(https://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan54/Single+Element+View , last paragraph ""History"") - but we don't have such a menu-entry under ""Administration"". 

(Note that history was always enabled in previous versions via the iteraplan.properties entry described above, and the history was migrated to version 5.4, runtime of the historyMigrationTool.jar was >24 hours).

thank your for your inquiry. 

After the History Migration and using the Version 5.4 of iteraplan, the history in the old client is not longer availlible.
When you change into the ""Interactive Client"" and the tab ""Administatrion"" -> ""System"" is it possible to activate the history. 

The setting ""history.enabled=true"" in the file ""iteraplan.propierties"" has no longer a effect in version 5.4.

After you activated the history in the interactive client, you have the tab ""History"" in the single element view of the interactive client.

Greetings,

thanks for the Information, it works now like expected.

Kind Regards,
