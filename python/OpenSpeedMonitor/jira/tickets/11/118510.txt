Problem with NULL on the tables ATG and ATTR (Login not possible)	"Reproduce with trunk and version 5.5



When you have a ""NULL"" in the columns ""LAST_MOD_USER"" and ""LAST_MOD_TIME"" in the tables ""ATG"" and ""ATTR"" you can not login in the interactive client. 



Many of our customers have created a bug ticket for that. 



When change all ""NULL's"" to a correct value, the software starts again. 



Which is the best way to clear it, SQL script? "		Bug	iteraplan PO	12/Apr/17 10:01 AM	19/Apr/17 2:20 PM
