Visualization: All element names link to single element view	"In all diagrams, all names should be links to the single element view.



-Idea: try to use the GoJS's [HyperlinkText object|http://gojs.net/latest/extensions/Hyperlink.html].-"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	27/Mar/17 10:58 AM	08/May/17 1:14 PM														28/Apr/17 4:06 PM;roia;[~msr], single element page should be opened in the sameÂ tab or in new one?	"02/May/17 11:32 AM;mkt;My suggestions to this task:

 # for single element view

 ** either show in new tab

 ** or show in the same tab but add button to go back to navigator

 ** or show it in the same tab as pop-up window (sth like preview)

 # [~roia], answering your question from our daily today

 ** let's do single click a hyperlink

 ** and double click an extension for current view

 *** question: won't double click open single element view twice?

 ** those options are dependent on how we implement single element view
