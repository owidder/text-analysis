Attribute - "Activated for the following Building Block Types" permission handling	"*Reproduce:*

 * Login with user which doesn't have permissions for some Building Block Types

 * Open some single attribute view page (e.g Accountability)



*Actual:* in ""Activated for the following Building Block Types"" section displayed translation keys for building block types without permissions (see screenshoot)

 *Expected:* in ""Activated for the following Building Block Types"" section all building block types will be displayed/named correctly

(Every user with permission to edit attributes, can activate an attribute for all generally available building blocks, not only for the ones he has the building block permission for)
