Installer saves wrong settings when used twice	"Reproduce:



# Use iteraplan corporate installer to install iteraplan with iturm

# Use same installer again and install iteraplan with ldap



Expected:

* Itrum is not deployed in the ldap installation



Actual:

* Although ldap is selected as authentification method, there is still a installation step askaing for the itrum deployment name (see screenshot)



Analysis:

* The installer probably stores the settings of the first installation and thinks that he has to show the itrum deployment step also in the second (ldap) installation

* Not really critical because itrum will be deployed but not be used in the ldap installation"		Bug	iteraplan Speedbird	13/Feb/17 11:02 AM	25/May/17 6:08 PM														"21/Apr/17 5:00 PM;fka;The saving of settings is done intentionally. It has to do something with the public demo system.
