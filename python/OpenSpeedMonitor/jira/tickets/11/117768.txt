Unify breadcrump navigation in the header	"All ""Back to List"" buttons should be replaced with breadcrumb navigation.

 * located in the same line as ""iteraplan"" logo, which is also homepage button, see attachement

 * an icon from angular materials: *chevron right*

 * icon used as first  element [>] (iteraplan logo > level1 > level 2 > ... > current location)

 * every level should be a link to corresponding location, excluding current location

 * default breadcrumb should be visible on:

 ** Building Block Type

 ** Building Block Attribute

 ** Building Block Role

 ** when using shortcuts (links):

 *** from another single element

 *** from diagram

 *** from link

 *** from list
