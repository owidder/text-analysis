MPD diagram needs to be updated for GoJS 1.7.x	"After GoJS update from version 1.6.11 to 1.7.7 MPG diagram is rendered not properly:

 # the timespan header is not rendered properly. Maybe, related to {{""InitialLayoutCompleted""}}Â in {{mpdDataDiagramHelper.js}}

 # -The exported image (JPEG, PNG) has no gridlines (probably, GoJS bug, and support contact is needed)- - already fixed
