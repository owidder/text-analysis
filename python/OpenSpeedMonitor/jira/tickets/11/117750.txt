thanks for your inquiry. 

You are right, the Buttons are missing in the IE 11. I have created a bug ticket, to solve this in verison 6.0.
The Layout tab has the following functions:

# Repulsion = Separates the Nodes from each other (distance)
# Stiffness = Sets the stiffness of the spring representing an edge
# Edge Length = Sets the length of all edges 

That is the official description from the library which was used for that. 
I will ask our specialist for the Information Flow diagram, to give you clearer answer.

Greetings,
