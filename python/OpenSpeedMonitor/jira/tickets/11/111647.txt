Logout/Login does not work in Internet Explorer 10	"The logout/login process does not work with IE10:



* ITurm:

** Login works

** But when the user logs out, he is immediatly logged in again



* LDAP:

** Login is not working



I used the virtual machine ""sql-iteraplan.iteratec.de"", which has IE10 installed, and connected to my local tomcat instance from there to test login/logout.



Please, double-check also LDAP+SSO with IE10! To do this:



# Configure Kerberos for Internet Explorer: https://ping.force.com/Support/PingFederate/Integrations/How-to-configure-supported-browsers-for-Kerberos-NTLM

# iteraplan with LDAP+SSO is installed here: sql-iteraplan.iteratec.de/iteraplanSSO"		Bug	iteraplan PO	13/Feb/17 2:10 PM	15/Feb/17 1:02 PM
