Buttons for Name input field	"In case of input field for column ""Name"", only _prepend_ and _append_ buttons should be active.



This text-input can't be set or cleared in Mass Update."		Improvement	iteraplan Speedbird	29/Mar/17 9:09 AM	31/Mar/17 3:39 PM														"31/Mar/17 2:40 PM;roia;[~msr], [~mkt], in my opinion, having buttons present in the editor can make user think, that there's some case when they can be used.



Fact that they are present, but can never be used can confuse user."	"10/Apr/17 10:13 AM;mkt;And how is it with hiding buttons?

Name field is the only text input with such restrictions, is it possible to easily hide those buttons only from this one input field?"	"10/Apr/17 3:49 PM;roia;[~mkt], yes, it's possible to hide them. At the moment they are visible, but inactive, but it's easy to hide them – it's just setting ""true"" value to a property ""ng-hide"" instead of ""ng-disabled"", like it is implemented now.
