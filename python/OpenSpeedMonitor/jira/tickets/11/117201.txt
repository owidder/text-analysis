Make metamodel structure image available via start screen	"2 parts in this ticket:

 * Remove unneeded JS-code of no longer used shadows on the homescreen

 * implement new toggle to switch between 2 views within the data tile in the startscreen. The first view is identical to the current one. The second view is new, it should show the metamodel structure (with connections between elements etc., comparable to the start screen in the classic client)



 ** Use a static svg for the second view. Needs to be created: tiles with connections, self-relations and legend for self-relations. FKA has to approve it.

 ** the toggle state should be saved for the user - so if user changes the view to data, the previously selected view should be displayed

 ** without a certain BBT-permission the element should just not be clickable. no other change, its a static SVG

 ** the toggle itself: ask SBU whre to place it and how it should look like

In German the link to Architectural Domains is broken.



All the other links are working and it looks good.
