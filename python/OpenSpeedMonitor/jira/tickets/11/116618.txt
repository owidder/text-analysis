Coloring in all visualizations: Improve	"h2. Toolarea

 * Replace coloring-toolarea-entry in all diagrams with a searchable dropdown (like ""add column"") of attributes

 * Default value is ( ({color:red}UPDATE: {color}use existing coloring icon of the toolarea)) icon (from the ""Add Column component"") and ""Color by"" / ""FÃ¤rbe nach""

 * When one attribute was selected, show an icon for coloring (""Farbkreis"") the attribute name and an ""X"" to remove in the toolarea



h2. Legend

 * Remove attribute name of all colored boxes within the coloring legend (e.g. 25% -of Costs-), only mininum, XX%, maximum remains

 * Within the three middle colored boxes (25-75%) cut the bars (shorten) -and use the white space on the right side to show a dropdown for selecting the color scheme (red-to-green, etc.) -> Use GoJS-context menu for that, reusue color-scheme-icon from the old toolarea without any background-

 * Reuse bar length of the minimum and maximum-bars

 * Put the icon ({color:red}UPDATE: {color}use existing coloring icon of the toolarea) to show a dropdown for selecting the color scheme (red-to-green, etc.) next the title of the coloring in the legend (""Color by Costs"")"		New Feature	iteraplan Speedbird	27/Mar/17 10:12 AM	16/Jun/17 3:09 PM
