Internet Explorer not working with 5.5	"Hi,



I've recently upgraded to Iteraplan version 5.5 in our development environment, and so far we have seen significant upgrades in the quality of the interactive client when using Google Chrome. However, we still have numerous issues using the interactive client with browser Internet Explorer 11. The  search bar is not active, and no data will load when clicking on a data view (Technical component, infrastructure element, etc.). 



Is there any configuration or changes we can make so that IE 11 works better with version 5.5?





Regards,

Matt Bennett"		Technical question	iteraplan Support	27/Mar/17 9:05 PM	16/Apr/17 7:00 AM														"28/Mar/17 7:54 AM;cst;Dear Mr. Bennett,

thank you for your inquery. 

For the version 5.5. we need no ""special"" settings in the IE 11.
Do you have cleared the browser cashe before the test of 5.5?

Additionally you can add the iteraplan URL in the ""trusted sites list"" of the IE. 
If the compatibility view in your browser is active, this can be a reason for problems too. 

Could you please check the Browser-Log (F12) and post the result in this ticket, if the issue stays the same.

Greetings,

Christoph Stangl - iteraplan Support
