BusinessMappings cannot be edited when connection columns are not visible	"Reproduce:



# Go to BusinessMapping list

# Make sure all connected building block columns are deleted (i.e. IS, Product, BU, BP)

# Reload list

# Try to edit any attribute (e.g. support degree)



Expected:

* Attribute is edited



Actual:

* Error like ""The modification could not be saved. A Business Mapping must be connected with an Information System"" is shown



Cause: This is because the isValidBusinessMapping() check in ipList-component.js, l. 527, does not work anymore, as the information about connected building blocks is only filled when the columns are added."		Bug	iteraplan PO	08/Feb/17 12:49 PM	09/Feb/17 9:50 AM														"08/Feb/17 1:26 PM;mse;After discussion with [~sfe] and [~msr]: Validation of business mappings must be done in client as validation on server is a major change, because server deletes invalid business mappings at the moment.



Solution:

* Client loads information from datamodel if not present in list

* OUT OF SCOPE IN THIS TICKET: Editing of business mapping connections is not allowed for users without sufficient permissions (to be implemented in ITERAPLAN-5095)"
