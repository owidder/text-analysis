import error when date is blank	"When importing a file, a warning is displayed for every blank date field in the file.   This issue was reported with v.5.3 (IP-194).  It was promissed to be fixed in the next version.  It still exists with v.5.5.  



The proposed workaround below is not practical with an import file of 5000+ elements times 6 dates per element .... trying to find all the blank dates ... rewrite them ... and repeat this process 4 times in a day.



When can we expect this issue to be fixed?

Hello Hannes,thank your for your feedback. I changed the column types in ""Date"" in every empty row, entered a fake Date, copied these in every row and delete it afterwards.  Why this is necessary, I dont know. It could be a Excel ""speciality"". For this issues I created a Bug-Ticket and it will be fixed in the upcoming versions.
