Editor of Productiv period switches day and month	"The language should be English.



Edit the year of a productiv period in single element view (or the list view) of a information system.



Expected behaviour: The productiv period is saved and only the year changes



Current behaviour: Day and month switch their value (eg. 03/07/2020 becomes 07/03/2020)



Please check after fixing, if it is still working correctly in German
