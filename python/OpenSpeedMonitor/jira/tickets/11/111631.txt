thank your for your inquiry.

In the Problem Report the Stacktrace is missing. 
Was the ""Stacktrace"" in the original Problem Report created? 

If so could you please attach the StackTrace to the ticket. 

Greetings,

the error messages mentioned before were the only messages occuring in the iteraplan.log-logfile. There were no StackTrace information."	"20/Feb/17 9:36 AM;cst;Dear Sir or Madam,

thank your for your inquiry.

I checked the problem again and this issue was fixed in version 5.5 of iteraplan.
After the update to version 5.5, the problem dosent appear anymore.

thank you for your answer.
What are the consequences of this error?
"	"20/Feb/17 11:14 AM;cst;The reason for this error is, that a subscribed element cannot subscribed again from the same user.
In Version 5.3 the software dont block this database request and the error above occures.

Does this sql-constraint violation cause any abnormal behaviour within iteraplan or leads to an inconsistent state for the subscription settings?"	"20/Feb/17 2:41 PM;cst;He tries to execute the sql query and add the subscriptions into the database. After he hurt the uniquies constraint he stops the query.
When you go back and start the subscriptions again the error occures immediately.

It creates no inconsistent state for the subscription settings, but it is very unhandy in the ui. 
My advice is the upgrade to version 5.5. We added a very much new features in interactive client and remastert the history function.  

Additional your problem is fixed.

Greetings,
