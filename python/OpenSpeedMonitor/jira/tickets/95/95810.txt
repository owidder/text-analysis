Create custom zoom handler	"*Actual*

In current implementation of cluster diagram zooming uses spacing rather than scaling.

It means newZoom = oldZoom * zoomStep

https://gojs.net/latest/samples/spacingZoom.html



*Expected*

Zoom works like scaling. That means newZoom = oldZoom + zoomStep

http://gojs.net/latest/samples/scrollModes.html



minZoom = 5%

zoomStep = 5%

maxZoom = 200%

Before a zooming action of the user happens, always show the whole diagram (i.e. adjust the zoom level after each change to diagram.) After the first zooming of the user, the user ist repsonsible for adjusting the zoom, do not change the zoom level automatically any more.



Not worked correctly.
