Add saved query name and save buttons with dialog to list and diagram pages	"# Add saved query name in the header: directly next to the building block name/report category, truncated to 30 characters with ...

# Add buttons in the header: directly next to the saved query name, only show buttons for list and diagram views:

## ""Save As..."" button: Opens a modal dialog for saving the saved query with its metainformation (Translation: ""Speichern unter...)

## ""Save"" button: only shown if a saved query is loaded; saves the query immediately without change of name and description

# Build modal dialog

## See [^Modal_dialog_Save_query_as.jpg] but use Angular Material Style

## Fields: name (input, max 255 characters), description (textarea, max 4000 characters)

## ""Save"" button

## ""Discard"" button

## Because the name is unique if a 409 (Conflict, ""Name already exists"") is returned by the REST API show a warning to the user below the name input field and disable save button."
