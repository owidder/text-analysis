No zooming, just calculating size of diagram according to the user's screen."	27/Sep/16 2:37 PM;roia;[~dmkh] I've made some optimizing refactoring (mostly in the PcdDataService) in revision 4469. Please review if you don't mind them. Also I've left some parts of code commented to be able to compare new implementation with the previous one.	27/Sep/16 3:52 PM;dmkh;[~roia], thanks! Everything looks now even better, committed my changes in 4476 and 4487.
