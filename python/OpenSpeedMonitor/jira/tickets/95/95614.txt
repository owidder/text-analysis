RELEASE: Disable 'is' or 'is not' filter operators for multivalue attributes 	"*Actual*

If you select for example 'Accountablity' you are able to select 'is' or 'is not' operators.



*Expected*

Since 'Accountablity' is multivalue attribute filter operators 'is' or 'is not' should not be on the list.



Disable 'is' or 'is not' filter operators for multivalue attributes.

User has to use 'contains' operator instead.



Probably it's necessary to update user guide as well."		Bug	iteraplan Quickfox	08/Sep/16 4:40 PM	17/Oct/16 2:03 PM														"14/Sep/16 11:17 AM;fka;Implementation might be as follows:

For all multivalue attributes

Remove contains & contains not, rename is & is not to contains & contains not



Why? We want to have a dropdown with values for contains & contains not, not a substring free text search field "
