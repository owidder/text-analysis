Continuous elastic update misses changes when releases are renamed	"_Reproduce (with sample data):_

# In classic client, edit information system _CRM # 3.1_

# Change name to _CRM-changed # 3.1_

# => In classic client, two information systems _CRM-changed # 3.1_ and _CRM-changed # 3.2_ exist

# Export Excel data from Mass Data->Export/Import



_Expected:_ Excel contains two information systems _CRM-changed # 3.1_ and _CRM-changed # 3.2_

_Actual:_ Excel contains two information systems _CRM-changed # 3.1_ and wrongly _CRM # 3.2_
