Forgot password of system account in UAT system	I forgot the password of the system account of our UAT system. Is it possible to reset it? If yes, how?		Fault	iteraplan Support	12/Sep/16 3:54 PM	12/Sep/16 4:23 PM														"12/Sep/16 4:10 PM;cst;Hello Mr. Liskow,

with this post you become the crypted password  for the column ""password"" in the iturm table ""im_user"". 

5F4DCC3B5AA765D61D8327DEB882CF99 

After that, you can login with your account and the password:

 ""password"".
