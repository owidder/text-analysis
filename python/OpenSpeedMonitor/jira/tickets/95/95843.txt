Extend REST API for Responsibilty and use it in interactive client	"*Actual*

The reponsibility attributes are not contained in the metamodel (api/icmm).

The only possibility is to iterate over whole data and find all occurenses

However:

* the responsibility will be represented as a text attribute

* If a possible value is not assigned to any element there is no possibility to get this value



*Solution*

* Extend REST API on backend to get all responsibility attributes

* Use new REST Resource in new client

* Look for similar solution in the task ITERAPLAN-4648



Since responsibilties are very similar to enumeration attributes, return similar JSON-Response by calling new REST-Resource
