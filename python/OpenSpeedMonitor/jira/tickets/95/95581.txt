thank you for your enquiry.

Can you please check the infoFlow diagram with the internet explorer,
or occurs the same problem as in firefox?

"	"09/Sep/16 8:40 AM;thomas.liskow@coface.com;It works in IE 11. Because we have a lot of building blocks/information system (433 overall, thereof 322 current and productive) the message ""In your actual browser only the first 250 elements are displayed"" appears.

for the firefox the maximal displayed elements are 500. 
Appears the diagram, when you wait a little bit?

At the moment this is the default limit for the shown elements. 
This limit cant be changed

In the future it is possible to change this limit, but in iteraplan 5.3 this feature is not implement.
As work a round you can use the internet explorer to create the diagram.

yes, if I wait some minutes the diagram appears. But if I try to add a node filter FF doesn't response any more. It's frozen and must be closed (see attached screenshot)

the problem is, that your computer can not handle the 433 elements of the diagram.
I have created a improvement ticket for this issues, to set the displayed elements.  

Would you please check following Troubleshooting article to improve the performance in interactive client:

I created the approbriate service requests for our user acceptance system. If this would work I will do it also for production system	"19/Sep/16 8:13 AM;thomas.liskow@coface.com;We made an upgrade to 5.3 and enabled the communication compression as mentioned in the document. Now the problem is solved and the flow diagram is displayed in a short time.
Please close the incident

Kind regards,
