Coloring by numeric attributes	"Do not forget the colorpicker.

*Summary*

Add coloring by numeric attribute values using value ranges.



*Details*

Create pie chart segments not for single numeric values but for the computed range.

There is also a segment for elements with no value => undefined



*Computation of the the range*

-Need to be discussed with [~fka]-

Probably already implemented in the ticket IPTS-121



Let look at all possible cost values from the bank data. The list is already sorted

1.00, 10.00, 15.00, 38.00, 40.00, 50.00, 80.00, 100.00, 300.00, 400.00, 500.00, 600.00, 700.00, 800.00, 900.00, 1000.00, 2000.00, 4000.00, 5000.00



In the old client we have following range: <38, 38-100, 100-600, 600-700, > 700



Here is the implementation idea to create ranges for numeric values in the new client.

# Get count of the elements in the list. If there are just 5 or less values, just display this values

# otherwise compute delta = count / 5

# For range values get element at positions delta, 2*delta, 3*delta, 4*delta



So for the costs we have delta = 19 / 5 = 3.8. We would take the element at position 3, 7, 11, 15 => these are 15, 80, 500, 900

The range is then < 15, 15-80, 80-500, 500-900, >900

We use the computed ranges as follow: the lower bound is included, the upper bound is excluded. In our case that means => v<15, 15<=v<80, 80<=v<500, 500<=v<900, v>=900



Please note, we will need this computation also in other diagrams => that's why it should be kind of common functionality."	95425	Sub-task	iteraplan Speedbird	06/Sep/16 11:46 AM	19/Oct/16 4:01 PM														"28/Sep/16 3:29 PM;msr;This task is mainly about extending the DecoratorFactory to work with the new ranges (calculation of ranges shown above).

Second step is to use the extended DecoratorFactory to have determinstic colors.



This should not change the coloring of other diagrams."	"13/Oct/16 10:27 AM;msr;Default color scheme by clicking on an attribute is ""red to green"".



* Only if a numeric attribute was selected: Additionally add a toolarea-entry ""Color scheme"" (German: ""Farb Schema) right after the ""attribute""-toolarea-entry

** Sub-menu: ""Dark to light"" (German: ""Dunkel nach hell"")

** Sub-menu: ""Red to green"" (German: ""Rot nach gr√ºn"")

* The actual selected toolarea entry is highlighted
