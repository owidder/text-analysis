SQL Query to get name change 	"Dear iteraplan support, 



we have to access the iteraplan DB directly because history is not available in REST API.



For InformationSystem we need to know if there was an name change today and what the new and the previous names were. 



We were able to find this information in history database but we cannot seperate it from other changes like it is in history tab (see attachement).



Please help us formulate this query. 

Thanks in advance, 

BR,

thank you for your enquiry. 

At the moment you cannot access with REST API on the history. 
A Query for the database is not practical, because the history tables have very special logic and canâ€™t be accessed with SQL statements. 

With version 5.4 or 5.5 youn can accecs the history with REST API.

thank you for your quick answer. We will then wait for 5.4 or 5.5 and have to look for a workaround till it's available in the REST API.
