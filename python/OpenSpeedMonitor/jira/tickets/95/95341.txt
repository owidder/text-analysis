Adjust Timer functionality	"The timer should start after the first settings change.

If the user changes the page the settings shall be written and the timer shall be stopped.

If timer is running and a settings change is made there should happen nothing.

If the timer expires the settings will be saved and the timer will be stopped."		Improvement	iteraplan Quickfox	06/Sep/16 2:18 PM	16/Sep/16 10:32 AM														"08/Sep/16 4:15 PM;pma;DONE:

* all points for ifd, lsd and ncd



TODO:

* check in mpd and pfd: 

** go to mpd

** timer is not set as expected

** click on ""coloring"" -> ""level1"" -> ""State of Health""

** timer is not set while it should

** analogously for all other changes and pfd

** while debugging: every change calls the method ""updateUrl"" where the settings in the userSettings service are stored. But before that the settings are already changed so that in the method userSettingsService.saveSettings() the object comparison always returns true and no timer is started. Additionally, i noticed that the configurationParameters are all called on ""this"" instead of ""that"". In the diagrams where the timerstart works (ifd, lsd, ncd) the configurationParameters are called on ""that"".

* check in list:

** go to information system list

** refresh the side

** timer is set while it should not"	15/Sep/16 5:49 PM;mwe;Fixed all user settings things for List, Landscape Diagram, Nested Cluster, Information Flow, Masterplan Diagram and Portfolio Diagram. The Cluster Diagram was not ready enough to completely integrate the user settings. Has to be done in another Issue.
