Filter Information Systems by version	"*Summary*

Filter Information Systems by their release version.



*Affected parts*

* Toolarea

* Text input bar in the filtering dialog

* URL

* Legend (read-only)

* ifdDataService

* ifdConfiguration



*Approach*

Filter Information Systems by release version directly in the ifdDataService. Create a helper class in the commons-module, which parses the name of Information Systems and use "" # "" as seperator for the version.

Use ifdConfiguration to notice other components about filtering.



*UI*

Set the filter either in the toolarea dialog and then proceed with the text input bar within this dialog.

Please use for-loop instead of forEach as it is faster ( https://coderwall.com/p/kvzbpa/don-t-use-array-foreach-use-for-instead ). Please use a ""break"" to leave the loop as soon you have found the fitting entry."	16/Oct/15 12:41 PM;lwi;tests are an extra ticket
