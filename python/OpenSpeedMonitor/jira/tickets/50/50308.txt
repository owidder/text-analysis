Filter Information Systems by enumeration attributes	"*Summary*

Filter Information Systems by enumeration attributes with operator ""is"" with list of possible values.



*Affected parts*

* (/) Toolarea (done by TAM)

* (/) Legend (read-only)

* (/) URL

* (/) ifdDataService

* (/) ifdConfiguration



*Approach*

* (/) Filter Information Systems by enumeration attributes directly in the ifdDataService.

* (/) Use ifdConfiguration to notice other components about filtering.

* (/) Please keep in mind, that this solution should work for further filterings by numeric, date and text.



*UI*

* Set the filter either in the toolarea (same entries).

* Delete the actual set filter via the toolarea (current filter -> dialog -> show current filter in dialog and change or delete it)."
