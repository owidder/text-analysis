Filter Information Systems by date attributes with date (range) picker	"*Summary*

Filter the Information Systems by date attributes with the help of the date (range) picker.



*Affected parts*

* Toolarea

* Date (range) picker in the filtering dialog

* URL

* Legend (read-only)

* ifdDataService

* ifdConfiguration



*Approach*

Filter Information Systems by date attributes directly in the ifdDataService.

Use ifdConfiguration to notice other components about filtering.



*UI*

Set the filter in the toolarea filtering dialog. After selecting a filter open the Date Picker in this dialog.

	* both use translateDate (from utils.js)

		* in ifdToolAreaViewModelBuilder.js in convert Function

		* in ifdLegendBuilder.js in drawFilters

		* But the usage code is copy-pasted.

		* Maybe it can be refactored

	* convertDate will be always called, also if filterItem is not of date range type?

	

/trunk/app/js/common/commonHeader/toolArea/toolAreaController.js

			function updateCurrentFilters(actionType) {

                if (actionType == ""applyFilter"") {

                    toolAreaBuilder.updateCurrentFilters();

                }

            };

			Not part of the ticket, but why ""=="" and not ""===""?

			

/trunk/app/js/ifd/ifdConfiguration.js

	* Why valueFrom and valueTo are part of translationData?

		filterItem.translationData = {

			//attrOwner: attrOwner,

			attr: attrTranslationKey,

			valueFrom: new Date(parseInt(filterItem.filterValues[0],10)),

			valueTo: new Date(parseInt(filterItem.filterValues[1],10))

		};

	* formatDate was added, but its usage removed. A guess: the function should be also removed?"	"18/Sep/15 11:46 AM;isc;* (/) ifdToolAreaViewModelBuilder and ifdLegendBuilder

* toolAreaController -> I think in this case, the strict validation is not necessary

* ifdConfiguration.js -> we need this for the legend"
