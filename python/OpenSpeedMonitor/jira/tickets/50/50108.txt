Highlight changed files in reactor filelist	"As user executing xsl transformations in the iteraplan reactor, I want to know and see which files my transformation has changed.

One possibility is to highlight files which changed since start time of the transformation.



Possible implementation:

# Extend result of a transformation REST request to contain the timestamp of when the transformation started

# Extend file list resource by optional timestamp parameter. The server checks for each returned file whether it is newer than the given parameter and sets an appropriate flag in the response.

# Use the timestamp returned in 1. for the successive file list request after a transformation

# Client highlights files which are flagged according to 2."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	07/Jul/15 12:37 PM						reactor
