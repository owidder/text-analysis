Certain deletion processes using import cause NullPointerException	"_Reproduce:_

# Download Excel Data

# In the Excel file, remove a line from the Project sheet. Choose a Project which has a usage relation to another project.

# Delete the PROJ-PROJ sheet from the Excel file

# Make other adjustments to restore data consistency within the Excel file, if necessary

# Import Excel file with overwrite strategy



_Expected:_ The Project removed in the Excel file is deleted, other building blocks are untouched (except removed relationships to the deleted Project).

_Actual:_ General error message on Import page in fourth step, NullPointerException in iteraplan log



_Reason:_ The deletion of the Project is done based on the MaskingMetamodel, which hides the usage relationship. So the Project(s) using or used by the deleted Project never lose their relation to it. This causes the issue during cycle validation.



_Fix:_ Make the deletion based on the complete (non-masking) metamodel."		Bug	iteraplan PO	09/Jul/15 5:53 PM	14/Jul/15 10:35 AM					import
