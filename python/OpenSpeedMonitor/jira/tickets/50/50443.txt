Aggregate relationships from excluded child elements upwards	"If a hierarchy filter is applied, all relationships to the axis elements of content elements that are not displayed shall be aggregated upwards to the lowest element that is displayed.



Note that this aggregation must be applied only for elements excluded by the hierarchy filter. Elements that are excluded by other filters are ignored. These ""other"" filters are applied ""before"" the hierarchy aggregation.



*Implementation idea:*

After ITERAPLAN-3790 axis assignments in LSD items should be a list of tuples.

Add the assignment tuples of each descendant to the item, if following condition is fulfilled:

* The descendent fulfills all filter conditions except the hierarchy filter



To check this, change the return type of {{lsdDataService.getContentItems}}:

* Currently, an array of business objects fulfilling all filter conditions is returned

* Change the return type to be an object containing two arrays: The array of objects fulfilling all filter conditions (as before), and the array of objects fulfilling all filter conditions except the hierarchy filter

* (also rename the method to ""getContentBOs"" to avoid misunderstandings as the actual content items are built afterwards).



Now each descendant can simply be checked against the second array to decide whether its relationship assignments should be included or not."	47337	Sub-task	iteraplan PO	10/Jul/15 4:20 PM	01/Oct/15 2:31 PM
