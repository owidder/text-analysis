Partial Diagram for LSD	"In the LSD, add a limitation for the number of cells _and_ number of content elements.

If limited, add pseudo row and/or column headers, and a warning in the legend.



To limit the number of cells, count the elements for the x-axis and for the y-axis.

Limit both numbers independently, for example 50 rows and 40 columns.

Taking the one dimension into account when limiting the other might be better, but is also more complicated.



After that, also count the content elements.

If the content elements are above the threshold, 

reduce the length of both axes.

Use a simple formula, for example:

if there are 4n content elements, and n is the threshold, then cut both axes in half.

Hopefully the content elements are not only in the top left quarter. 



Repeat if required, but only up to 3 times.



Pseudo elements are in the top right and bottom left header cell, and in the bottom right content cell.

Warning note in the legend.



To find the actual threshold value, experiment in adverse environment, that is IE.

Then put it into the code. No config."		Improvement	iteraplan PO	14/Jul/15 12:30 PM	21/Sep/15 3:08 PM					lsd	performance
