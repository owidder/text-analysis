Wrong behaviour of Breadcrumbs	"how to reproduce:

* Go to Projects -> Breadcrumbs view changes to ""Project""

* Now go back to the start screen (Back button in Browser | Breadcrumbs back button | iteraplan logo)



Should: Breadcrumbs changes to ""Home"" 

Is: Breadcrumbs view do not change"		Bug	iteraplan PO	14/Jul/15 10:56 AM	16/Jul/15 3:27 PM														"15/Jul/15 10:31 AM;ach;* problem caused by 

{code}

$scope.getBreadcrumbItemText = function(){

return  $scope.breadcrumbItemText ? $scope.breadcrumbItemText : $scope.breadcrumb;

};

{code}

                            in *commonHeader directive*, after visiting Category *breadcrumbItemText* stays setted.

* there are *two* ways: 

    ** to set breadcrumbItemText to undefined explicitly on each route change.

    ** to use $scope.breadcrumb only (no short breadcrumbs text any more)

* decided to second solution because of the upcoming localisation (hard coded text will be replaced anyway)   "
