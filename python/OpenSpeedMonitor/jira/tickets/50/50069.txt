TBD: Improve layouting algorithm	"Improve the layouting algorithm for the Information Flow Diagram with the help of GoJS's LayoutNetwork.

For spefic requirements to the layout, check the wiki-page for the layout ""Blockbildung"" on https://iteraweb.iteratec.de/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=52134452#InformationFlowDiagram%28IFD%29-ParadigmaBlockbildung .



With the help of LayoutNetwork you can (independently of nodes and edges) set your own ""priorities"" for a Standard Layout (we use: ForceDirectedLayout)



Please refer to:

http://gojs.net/latest/api/symbols/LayoutNetwork.html



Outsource the existing layoutNetwork code from the ifdDiagramBuilder to the Layouter.



(*Update:*

Please have a look at the bottom of the diagram. At the moment the two elements on the bottom are cropped. Please correct the size of the canvas.

-> This is already fixed)
