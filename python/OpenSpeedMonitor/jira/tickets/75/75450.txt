Duration has Date as PresentationType	"clarify with [~wfr]

Valuetype Duration in valuetype.js has ""date"" as PresentationType

because of that singleFilterHolder create an singleDateFilter for duration attributes (e.g. runtime periode)



clarify, which behaviour is proper. 

Adjust createNewSingleFilterObject() of singleFilterHolder. (Use Value.Type.PRESENTATION constants instead of hard coded values in swith statement)

check if singleDurationFilter works properly."		Bug	iteraplan PO	02/Mar/16 2:08 PM	15/Jun/16 4:22 PM					filter									15/Jun/16 4:22 PM;sfe;Was probably fixed in some other context already
