I apologize for the late reply.
We can only offer one account for read access to the developer ticket system for each company. This account was created for Dan Robinson after consulting with Alexander Zindl, both from your company.
Accounts for the help desk ticketing system are unlimited and you have already created one to open this issue here.
If you have any further questions in this matter, please don't hesitate to ask.

Best regards
Stephan Feroudj"
