Make types selectable in tool area in the N3CD	"Implement the type selection in toolbar for the N3CD.



* the toolbar should work in conjunction with the configuration.

* new types should be selectable from the toolbar

* Relationship between outer and inner not yet configurable (not scope of this ticket)

* First simple protractor test (page object, click type selection, assertion)"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	01/Mar/16 12:28 PM	22/Apr/16 9:06 AM														"04/Apr/16 1:04 PM;gph;Still todo:

* Highlight selected tool area entry (inner/outer type)

* Write/read type selection to/from URL.

* Write a simple e2e test (""smoke test"")"	"12/Apr/16 4:47 PM;tam;/trunk/app/js/n3cd/ncdToolAreaViewModelBuilder.js

* 	getMenuEntriesForOuterTypes

* 	getMenuEntriesForInnerTypes

** 		Adjust JSDoc: rootNode is new parameter

** 		Is it possible to refactor both functions? These seem to be very identical to me.

** 		computeStyleForIndex is alsmost the same in both functions. Would it be enough to have it outside only once

** 		Also add JSDoc to computeStyleForIndex

* 	updateSelectHighlighting

** 		JSDoc?

** 		Should it be checked, that selectedIndex is not bigger than the length of entries? If this somehow happens, there will be exceptions then.

** 		Maybe too paranoid. Maybe it makes sense to discuss it with Wolfgang or Stephan.

* 	function computeIndexOuterItem(name)

* 	function computeIndexInnerItem(name)

** 		Are both functions really neccessary? IMO they can be removed



/trunk/app/js/n3cd/ncdController.js

* 		Just an idea. Would it be possible to refactor transferAction by move code for updateOuter and updateInner in separate function since almost the same things happen in these cases?"
