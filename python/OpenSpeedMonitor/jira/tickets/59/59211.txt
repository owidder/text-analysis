Show a loading indicator before home screen and for all diagrams 	"Show an indicator for all three current diagrams, that is NCD, LSD, IFD after changing the configuration and during (re-)drawing. NCD and LSD already exists.



Also show an indicator during model loading from REST before the home screen (like a splash screen ""in front of"" the home screen). The splash screen appears only if promise for REST request is not yet resolved.



The indicator can be simple, a message that disappears. No animation.
