NICE BUT LOW Saved diagram configurations in the new client	"This is a reserve ticket. Lowest priority after completing existing diagrams.



The user can save the currently configured diagram in the new client. A dialog pops up and asks for the name of the saved diagram.

The user can find the saved diagram and display it.

The user can delete saved diagrams of the homescreen.

The user is not able to rename the saved diagram.



Use the home screen for the new saved diagrams.



As a very first step, the saved diagrams may be stored locally in the browser.

Storing only during the session is NOT a solution.

The real solution stores the configurations on the server, sharing them between browser installations and workstations.





steps for save

1) user clicks global save button

2) client shows dialog for name

3) user enters name, no validation for uniqueness

4) user clicks ok

5) client stores the pair of name and the uri

6) client shows confirmation 

7) confirmation disappears (toast-like)



steps for use

1) user navigates to home screen

2) client shows all saved diagrams as tiles, below regular tiles

3) user clicks tile

4) client goes to diagram, just as in a regular saved link



steps for delete

1) client shows home screen with tiles, as above

2) user clicks delete icon 

3) client deletes saved query

4) client shows confirmation, disappearing

5) client re-renders home screen"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	06/Oct/15 10:46 AM	19/Jan/16 4:20 PM
