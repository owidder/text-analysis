Add logging for creation of a building block	"Add a log message for creation of a new building block.

This continues the idea of an older ticket that added a log message for deleted building blocks.

Two separate switches for for create and delete, using the logging config. NO extra config switch. "		New Feature	iteraplan PO	06/Oct/15 10:33 AM	06/Oct/15 11:01 AM
