3RD Party Library Update	"*Batik*

Currently we use version 1.7 of batik.

For this version exits a security fix for the XXE vulnerability CVE-2015-0250.

Check if we can update the version equal to 1.8 and update the version.

*jung API*

According to our Excel list we should no longer use the ""jung api"" (jung-algorithms.jar, jung-api.jar, jung-graph-impl.jar) but in the pom it is still inside.

It was/is maybe used in the classical IFD.

Please check if iteraplan need this libraries anymore. If iteraplan do not need this libraries, please remove this from pom file."		Task	iteraplan PO	05/Oct/15 2:15 PM	21/Oct/15 10:47 AM														"12/Oct/15 3:42 PM;tam;*Batik update*

After update batik to 1.8. no JPEG, PNG or PDF conversions are possible.

There are some issue opened in batik JIRA

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/BATIK-1126

Probably CVE-2015-0250 (*_XML external entity (XXE) vulnerability in the SVG to (1) PNG and (2) JPG conversion classes in Apache Batik 1.x before 1.8 allows remote attackers to read arbitrary files or cause a denial of service via a crafted SVG file._*) is not really relevant for us right now since we convert SVG internally, but it will be relevant for new client.



But maybe we can use 1.7.1 version

*_Note that the only change between versions 1.7.1 and 1.7 and between versions 1.6.1 and 1.6 is the security fix for the XXE vulnerability CVE-2015-0250 (see the XML Graphics Security page)._*



*jung API*

As discussed with [~sfe] the excel was adjusted since we still use jung API in our code"	21/Oct/15 10:47 AM;tam;Additionally updated batik version in the 3RD-PARTY_LICENSE.txt
