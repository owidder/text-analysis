Hide the "Data Sources" feature in all regular editions.	"Hide the menu entries for changing the data source (in the classic client).

Keep the feature working for all custom editions for clients that already use it.



Background: this feature is a candidate for discontinuation.



-Move the Configuration parts to a new (to be created) page.

Page is not linked in the menu, but reachable if one enters the address manually.

This is difficult to reach intentionally.-



The sections with the ""switch datasource"" button on the Configuration page AND the section with the user-specific assignment of a datasource on a user's detail page should be hidden by default. They are shown when a Http-parameter called ""datasources"" exists, for example "".../user/4?execution=e9s1&ds""  (as arranged with wfr).



No config switch."		New Feature	iteraplan PO	06/Oct/15 10:26 AM	09/Oct/15 12:59 PM
