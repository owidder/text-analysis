[LSD] Error if you change the axis association to an attribute	"If you change the axis association to an attribute, you get the following error:

{code}

Uncaught TypeError: a.name.localeCompare is not a function

{code}



*Reproduction*	

* open the LSD in the default configuration

* change the association of the y-axis to an attribute (it does not matter if you use the context menu or the tool area)



*current behavior*

* the chart is not updated

* you get an error in the js console"		Bug	iteraplan PO	05/Oct/15 3:18 PM	06/Oct/15 4:30 PM														06/Oct/15 9:44 AM;sfe;This is most likely related to a change done to the ordering of LSD axis elements. If yes: Just revert that change, as axis ordering already is topic of another issue, too.
