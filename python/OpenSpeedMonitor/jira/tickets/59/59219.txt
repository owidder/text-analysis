Change all links to and from the Interactive Client to buttons visually	"In the Classic Client and the Interactive Client, change all interconnecting links from the visual ""link"" appearance to a ""flat button"" appearance. Adapt and shorten wording if required.



For interactive client: Use layout of ""Language"" button as template

For classic client: Use layout of ""search"" button as template"		New Feature	iteraplan PO	06/Oct/15 10:24 AM	21/Oct/15 4:15 PM														"19/Oct/15 4:40 PM;mbr;Discussed and agreed upon with [~wfr] (idea by [~dam]):

Interactive client's header contains one button ""To Classic Client""/""Zum Classic Client"" that links to the corresponding page in the classic client.

E. g. if ""To Classic Client"" is clicked on NCD-page in the new client the user is directed to NCD-page in classic client."	"21/Oct/15 9:48 AM;lwi;added following lines to the docs at http://www.iteraplan.de/doc/display/iteraplan51/New+Client:



Switching back to the Classic Client

In the new Client on top right of every page you can find the button ""Show in classic client"". This button is context-sensitive, meaning that it will lead you to the corresponding page of the classic client. Concrete behaviour examples are:

Click on the Button at the home screen leads to home screen of classic client

Click on the Button at information flow diagram leads to information flow diagram configuration page in classic client

Click on the Button at information system table view page leads to the same table view page in classic client"	21/Oct/15 9:56 AM;lwi;everything looks fine, good work! But when clicking on "done" please post the link to the docs, as well as what you have changed there.
